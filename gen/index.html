    <h1>भर्तृहरिसुभाषितम्</h1>
    <p>The <b>subhāṣita</b>s (<b>Nīti-śataka</b>, <b>Vairāgya-śataka</b>, <b>Śṛṅgāra-śataka</b>) of <b>Bhartṛhari</b>
        are some of the most quoted verses from Sanskrit literature. There have been many books containing translations
        or commentaries of these poems. Each of them has a different subset of the verses, in a different order.
        <em>What if you could read all these books simultaneously?</em> That is, what if you could easily navigate from
        any poem in any book to other books’ versions of the same poem?
    </p>

    <p>This collection of webpages is a start in that direction. It puts together a few translations/collections
        ("books") of Bhartṛhari's poems:
    <ul>
        <li>English verse translations by Charles Henry Tawney and (as part of larger collections) by Arthur W. Ryder,
            by John Brough, by Paul Elmer More.</li>
        <li>Editions published in India with translation and notes, by K. T. Telang, by P. Gopinath, by Swami
            Mādhavānanda.</li>
        <li>The critical edition by D. D. Kosambi (based on examining ~380 manuscripts), which gives all the variant
            readings for each verse, and (crucially for us) can be used as a canonical numbering of all Bhartṛhari
            verses.</li>
        <li>(TODO/yet to add: The editions/notes by M. R. Kale, the commentaries by Rāmarśi and by Rāmacandra
            Budhendra, other Sanskrit and Indian-language commentaries, other prose translations, ….)</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>To navigate, start with one of the books below, and click on the "⟷" below any poem that looks interesting:</p>
    <ul>
        {% for title in books %}
        <li><a href="{{title}}.html">{{title}}</a></li>
        {% endfor %}
    </ul>
    <p>A second way to navigate would be <a href="search.html">search</a>.</p>
    <p>You could also browse the complete list of poems (verses):</p>
    <div style="max-height: 30em; overflow-y: scroll; border: 2px solid blue; border-radius: 30px;">
        <ul>
            {% for (k, text) in verses %}
            <li style="margin-top: 1ex;"><a href="{{k}}.html">{{k}}</a> {{text}}</li>
            {% endfor %}
        </ul>
    </div>
    <p style="margin-top: 2em;">You can use <a href="https://github.com/shreevatsa/bhartrhari">the GitHub repository</a>
        to report issues or other feedback, or to see the source code and data.</p>

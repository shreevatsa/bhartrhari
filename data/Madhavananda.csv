1. All glory to Śiva, the Light of Knowledge, residing in the temple of the yogīs’ heart, who smites away (like the rising sun) the massive front of the endless night of ignorance overcasting human minds, in whose wake follow all auspiciousness and prosperity, who burnt up gay lust as a moth, as if in sport, and who appears beaming with the lambent rays of the crescent adorning his forehead—rays that look pleasing like soft half-blooming buds!
[चूडोत्तंसित—made an ornament for the head. चारुकलिका­चञ्चच्छिखा—lambent beams like beautiful half-blooming buds. लीलादग्ध—burnt up at ease or in sport. श्रेयोदशाग्रे—in front of all circum­stances of prosperity. स्फुरन्—appearing. अन्त:स्फूर्जत्—spread­ing forth in the heart. प्राग्भारं—heavy mass at the front.
As is customary with Sanskrit poets, this opening verse is dedicatory (to Śiva in this instance), as forming an auspicious introduction.]",1
2,"भ्रान्तं देशमनेकदुर्गविषमं प्राप्तं न किञ्चित् फलम्
        त्यक्त्वा जातिकुलाभिमानमुचितं सेवा कृता निष्फला ।

        त्तृृष्णे जृम्भसि पापकर्मपिशुने नाद्यापि सन्तुष्यसि ।।२।।

2. Many are the inaccessible and perilous places I have travelled and yet obtained no riches; sacrificing proper dignity of birth and social position, in vain have I served the rich; like the crows have I fed myself, devoid of self-respect, at the house of others in the expectation of gain; and yet, oh! Desire, thou prompter of evil deeds, thou art waxing lustier and art not still satisfied.
[अनेकदुर्गविषमं—rendered difficult of access by various obsta­cles. फलं—result (but here), wealth. आशङ्कया—hankering (after gain). पापकर्मपिशुने—indicative of evil deeds.]",148
3,"उत्खातं निधिशङ्कया क्षितितलं ध्माता गिरेर्धातवो
        निस्तीर्ण: सरितां पतिर्नृपतयो यत्नेन संतोषिता: ।

        प्राप्त: काणवराटकोऽपि न मया तृष्णे सकामा भव ।।३।।
3. The earth have I digged into in quest of precious minerals, and metals from rocks have I smelted; the ocean have I crossed, and the favour of kings have I diligently sought; nights have I spent on burning grounds with my mind occupied with mantras and worship; (1) and not even a broken cowrie have I obtained; be satisfied, therefore, oh Desire!

[1] This forms a part of the mysterious rites to be gone through by those who invoke supernatural agencies for obtaining riches.",149
4,"खलालापा: सोढा: कथमपि तदाराधनपरै-

कृतो वित्तस्तम्भ­प्रतिहतधियामञ्जलिरपि
त्वमाशे मोघाशे किमपरमतो नर्तयसि माम् ।।४।।
4. In our servile attendance on the (wealthy) wicked, their shabby manners and talk we have somehow put up with; suppressing tears that welled up from our hearts, we have smiled out of vacant minds; obeisance we have made to dullards stultified by too much wealth; in what more fooleries wouldst thou have me dance, oh Desire, thou of ungratified yearning!
[वित्तस्तम्भप्रतिहतधियाम्—those rendered dull in intellect by in­ac­tivity due to too much wealth. मोघाशे—with hopes thwarted. Another reading is चित्तस्तम्भ: as a separate word. The meaning then would be: ‘We have restrained our feelings and made obeisance,’ etc.]",150
5,"अमीषां प्राणानां तुलितबिसिनीपत्रपयसां

        कृतं वीतव्रीडैनिर्जगुणकथा­पातकमपि ।।५।।
5. What have we not endeavoured to do, with our depraved conscience, for the sake of our prāṇas (five vital forces) which are unreliable and compared to water on the leaves of a lotus, since in the presence of the rich, with their minds stupefied by the pride of wealth, we have shamelessly committed the sin of recounting our own merits!
[According to the scriptures, self-glorification is tanta­mount even to the sin of suicide.]",168
6,"क्षान्तं न क्षमया गृहोचितसुखं त्यक्तं न संतोषत:

        तत्तत्कर्म कृतं यदेव मुनिभिस्तैस्तै: फलैर्वञ्चिता: ।।६।।
6. We have forgiven, but not out of forgiveness (but out of our incapacity to right our wrongs); we have renounced the comforts of home life, but not out of contentment after satisfaction (but as an exile from home in quest of riches); though we have suffered inclemencies of weather, cold and heat so difficult to bear, still it is not religious austerities that we have undergone; with subdued vital forces, night and day have we brooded on money and not on the feet of Śiva; thus we have performed those very acts which the munis (saintly recluses) do perform, but of their good effects we have deprived ourselves.",236
7,"भोगा न भुक्ता वयमेव भुक्ता-
        स्तपो न तप्तं वयमेव तप्ता: ।
कालो न यातो वयमेव याता-
        स्तृष्णा न जीर्णा वयमेव जीर्णा: ।।७।।
7. Worldly pleasures have not been enjoyed by us, but we ourselves have been devoured; no religious austerities have been performed, but we ourselves have become scorched; time is not gone (being ever present and infinite), but we ourselves are gone (because of approaching death). Desire is not reduced in force, though we ourselves are reduced to senility.
[Here there is an ironical pun on the participles भुक्ता: and तप्ता:, the former being used both in the sense of ‘enjoyed’ and ‘eaten up’, and the latter both in the sense of ‘(austerities) performed’ and ‘heated’. Similarly the participle जीर्णा: means both ‘reduced in force’ and ‘stricken down with age’. The effect, of course, cannot be preserved in translation.]",155
8,"वलीभिर्मुखमाक्रान्तं पलितेनाङ्कितं शिर: ।
गात्राणि शिथिलायन्ते तृष्णैका तरुणायते ।।८।।
8. The face has been attacked with wrinkles, the head has been painted white with grey hair, the limbs are all enfeebled; but desire alone is rejuvenating.",156
9,"निवृत्ता भोगेच्छा पुरुषबहुमानोऽपि गलित:
        समाना: स्वर्याता: सपदि सुहृदो जीवितसमा: ।

        अहो मूढ: कायस्तदपि मरणापायचकित: ।।९।।
9. Though my compeers, dear to me as life, have all taken such a speedy flight to heaven (before being overtaken by old age); though the impulse for enjoyment is wearied out and the respect commanded from all persons lost; though my sight is obstructed by deep blindness (or cataract) and the body can raise itself but slowly on the staff; still, alas for its silliness, this body startles at the thought of dissolution by death!",153
10,"आशा नाम नदी मनोरथजला तृष्णातरङ्गाकुला

मोहावर्तसुदुस्तरातिगहना प्रोत्तुङ्गचिन्तातटी

10. Hope is like a flowing river of which the ceaseless desires constitutes the waters; it rages with the waves of keen longings, and the attachments for various objects are its animals of prey; scheming thoughts of greed are the aquatic birds that abound on it, and it destroys in its course the big trees of patience and fortitude; it is rendered impassable by the whirlpools of ignorance, and of profound depth of bed as it is, its banks of anxious deliberation are precipitous indeed. Such a river the yogīs of pure mind pass across to enjoy supreme felicity.",173
11,"न संसारोत्पन्नं चरितमनुपश्यामि कुशलं
        विपाक: पुण्यानां जनयति भयं मे विमृशत: ।
महद्भि: पुण्यौघैश्चिरपरिगृहीताश्च विषया
महान्तो जायन्ते व्यसनमिव दातुं विषयिणाम् ।।११।।
11. I do not find the virtuous distinction produced (by ceremonial observances) through life after life to be conducive to well-being, for the sum of such virtuous merits when weighed in mind inspires fear in me. Enjoyments earned by great accession of merit, multiply so greatly in the case of people attached to them, only to bring them misery and peril!

[विपाक: पुण्यानां etc.—The idea is to show the futility of good deeds performed in our earthly life with the object of enjoying happiness in heaven or higher lokas, for the heavenly enjoyments are transitory as being the result produced by our virtuous merits; when the force of these merits is spent, the enjoyments must cease and the soul will again be drawn back to the cycle of births and deaths, until by jñāna or spiritual illumination, it attains mokṣa or final release from the wheel of transmigration.
व्यसनमिव दातुं —It indicates that the enjoyment of pleasures in heavens binds still more fetters on us by increasing our thirst and hence is the cause of an added volume of miseries.]
",263
12,"अवश्यं यातारश्चिरतरमुषित्वापि विषया

व्रजन्त: स्वातन्त्र्यादतुलपरितापाय मनस:
स्वयं त्यक्ता ह्येते शमसुखमनन्तं विदधति ।।१२।।
12. The objects of enjoyment, even after staying with us for a long time, are sure to leave us sometime; then what difference does their privation in this way make to men, that they do not of their own accord discard them? If the enjoyments leave us on their own initiative, i.e., if they tear themselves from us, they produce great affliction of the mind; but if men voluntarily renounce them, they conduce to the eternal bliss of self-possession.",157
13,"ब्रह्मज्ञानविवेकनिर्मलधिय: कुर्वन्त्यहो दुष्करं

न्वाञ्छामात्रपरिग्रहानपि परं त्यक्तुं न शक्ता वयम् ।।१३।।

13. Ah! It must be indeed a difficult feat which persons, with their minds purified by the discrimination arising from the knowledge of Brahman, accomplish, in that, free from desire, they wholly discard that wealth which has been actually bringing them enjoyment; whereas we fail to renounce enjoyments which are reaped by us as mere longings and which we never did realize in the past, nor do we realize now, nor can we count upon as lasting when obtained (in future).",283
14,"        धन्यानां गिरिकन्दरेषु वसतां ज्योति: परं ध्यायता-

                क्रीडाकाननकेलिकौतुकजुषामायु: परं क्षीयते ।।१४।।

14. Blessed are those who live in mountain caves meditating on Brahman, the Supreme Light, while birds devoid of fear perch on their laps and drink the tear-drops of bliss (that they shed in meditation); while our life is fast ebbing away in the excitement of revelry in palatial mansions or on the banks of refreshing pools or in pleasure-gardens, all created (and brooded over) merely by imagination.

[शकुना नि:शङ्कमङ्केशया:—The birds have approached them fearlessly, because they have reached the state of tranquility and harmlessness, realizing the oneness of life.]",196
15,"        भिक्षाशनं तदपि नीरसमेकवारं

                हा हा तथापि विषया न परित्यजन्ति ।।१५।।

15. For food, (I have) what begging brings and that too tasteless and once a day; for bed, the earth, and for attendant the body itself; for dress, (I have) a worn out blanket made up of a hundred patches! And still, alas! the desires do not leave me!

[विषया—Objects of desires haunting the mind.]",158

16. मांसग्रन्थी—Lumps of flesh (dual number). कनककलशा­वित्युपमितौ—(become) golden jugs in (poets’) comparison. श्लेष्मागारम्—seat of phlegm, saliva, etc. शशाङ्केन तुलितम्—is compared to the moon. करिवरशिर:स्पधिर्—claiming likeness with the ele­phant’s forehead. मुहुनिर्न्द्यं रूपं etc.—form deserving constant contempt has been magnified (in praise) by certain poets.",159
17,"एको रागिषु राजते प्रियतमादेहार्धहारी हरो

        शेष: कामविडम्बितान्न विषयान्भोक्तुं न मोक्तुं क्षम: ।।१७।।
17. Among sensual persons, Śiva  is unique, sharing half His body with His beloved; and again, among the dispassionate, there is none superior to Him, unattached to the company of women; while the rest of mankind, smitten and stupefied by the irresistible, serpent-like poisoned arrows of Cupid, and brought under the infatuation of Love, can neither enjoy their desires nor renounce them at will.
[प्रियतमादेहार्धहारी —This refers to the symbolic representation of Śiva and Gaurī in a single divided form.
                        On one side grows the hair in long and black curls,
                        And on the other, corded like rope;
                        One side is white with ashes, like the snow-mountains,
                        The other golden as the light of the dawn.
                        For He, the Lord, took a form,
                        And that was a divided form,
                        Half-woman and half-man.
भोक्तुं न मोक्तुं क्षम: —Ordinary persons, when they give them­selves up to enjoyments, lose all control and become slaves to them; so even when satiety comes, they cannot detach themselves from them, as the force of blind attachment has enslaved them. But Śiva, who has subdued His mind, is unaffected by them, as in His state of mental poise of yoga, pleasure and pain are the same to Him.]",224
18,"अजानन्दाहात्म्यं पततु शलभस्तीव्रदहने

	न्न मुञ्चाम: कामानहह गहनो मोहमहिमा ।।१८।।
18. Without knowing its burning power the insect jumps into the glowing fire; the fish through ignorance eats the bait attached to the hook; whereas we, even though having full discernment, do not renounce the sensual desires, complicated as they are with manifold dangers. Alas, how inscrutable is the power of delusion!",160
19,"                                तृषा शुष्यत्यास्ये पिबति सलिलं शीतमधुरं

                        19. When the mouth is parched with thirst, man takes some cold refreshing (or sweetened) drink; when suffering from hunger he swallows boiled rice made delicious with meat and the like; when set on fire by lust, he fast embraces his wife; so happiness is but remedying these diseases (of hunger, thirst and lust); and behold, how man (i.e., his sense) is upset in its quest!
                        [प्रतीकारं व्याधे: सुखमिति—The main point to be understood is that worldly happiness is but the temporary remedy we constantly seek for all the diseases with which worldly life is beset. When this relative and fugitive nature of happiness becomes apparent to us, we naturally give up running after it, to seek permanent peace in renunciation.]",253

			20. Possessed of tall mansions, of sons esteemed by the learned, of untold wealth, of a beloved wife of beneficence, and of youthful age, and thinking this world to be permanent, men deluded by ignorance run into this prison-house of worldliness; whereas blessed indeed is he who, considering the impermanence of the same world, renounces it.",252

			21. If one had an occasion to see one’s wife suffering without food and sore aggrieved at the constant sight of hungry crying children with piteous looks pulling at her worn-out clothes, what self-respecting man would for the mere sake of his own petty stomach utter ‘give me’ (i.e., become a supplicant for favour) in a voice faltering and sticking at the throat for fear of his prayer being refused?",152

                        22. The pit of our stomach so hard to fill is the root indeed of no small undoing: it is ingenious in severing the vital knots, as it were, of our fond self-respect; it is like the bright moonlight shining on the lotus (that species which blooms only in the sun) of highly estimable virtues; it is the hatchet that hews down the luxuriant creepers of our great modesty.",207

			23. For the sake of filling the cavity of the stomach when hungry, a man of self-respect would wander from door to door with an earthen begging bowl (in hand) having its edge covered with white cloth, away in extensive woodlands or holy places, the outskirts of which are grey all over with the smoke of sacrificial fires tended by Brāhmanas versed in ritualistic niceties, and thus preserve the prāṇas, rather than live (like) a beggar from day to day among those who are socially equals.
			[It should be remembered that living on alms for a man of true renunciation is held in high esteem in India, for no social merit can be higher than giving up the world for the sake of the national ideal of spirituality.
			Woodlands—where recluses live.
			Covered, etc.—this seems to have been the custom, to prevent the food from being seen by passers-by.]",179

			24. Ah! is it that those Himalayan solitudes, cooled by the spray of minute bits of Gaṅgā’s waves and abounding in beautiful rocky flats such as are the haunts of the Vidyādharas, are all engulfed in destruction, that men in disgrace hang on others for their maintenance?
			[कण and शीकर have much the same sense. For कण some read हिम, meaning cold.

			25. Or is it that herbs and roots have all disappeared from caves, and streams have gone away from hillsides, or that branches of trees bearing luscious fruits and yielding barks are all destroyed, that the faces of wretches, perfectly devoid of good breeding, are found to have their eyebrows dancing like creepers in the wind of an arrogance which their scanty earning eked out with hardship engenders in them?",184

			28. Reposing on a bed of stone within a mountain cave, during intervals of meditation, (well) may I recollect with an inward smile the days of those afflicted through their petitions before the rich, or of those grown mean through their minds being content with seeking enjoyments.
[If this verse is read differently with वर्धन्ते for वर्तन्ते and वासराणां for वासराणि the idea becomes, in the words of Mr. Telang: ‘The suppliant of the rich thinks the days too long as he has to suffer the trouble of constant entreaties often unsuccessful; the person engaged in the pursuit of worldly objects thinks time too short; he has never enough of it to compass all his numerous ends. On the other hand the philosopher laughs at both for their delusions.’ In this case ये in lines 1 and 2 refer to days, and for पर्याप्त in line 2 we have to read पर्यस्त too.]",174

Such being the case, for whom did the Creator create the Meru, representing inconceivable wealth, but confining to itself the glorious potency of its gold? I would not covet it.
			[कस्य कृते कृत: etc.—The idea is that Meru, the (fabled) mountain of gold, serves no useful purpose to anybody, and so I would not go in for it (न मे रोचते): because those that are contented feel quite happy without possessing it, and those that hanker after wealth never feel satisfied howsoever big might be their acquisitions. स्वात्मन्येव समाप्तहेममहिमा—Its gold serves only to glorify itself, but not to satisfy the greedy.]

			30. The great yogīs describe food which begging brings as follows: it does not humiliate (vide verse no. 23); it is an independent pleasure (i.e., not dependent on the pleasure of earning money, fulfilling social duty, etc.); it is in all respects free from any anxious fear (i.e., about one’s expenditure, foodstores, etc.); it destroys wicked pride, egotism and impatience; it eradicates the manifold evils of worldly existence; it is easily available anywhere any day without efforts; it is the beloved of the holy men; it is a purification by itself; it is like the inexhaustible feeding-house of Śiva, access to which none can prevent.",290

				Enjoyments are transitory individually and in­exhaustible collectively, so we are in a never-ending wild-goose chase which brings in turns stimulation and grief. Desire produces this terrible entanglement, and hope keeps it on. Therefore don’t exert yourself for these enjoyments, but, freeing your mind from hope and desire, set it high on its supreme goal.

			[These three stanzas (Nos. 45, 46, 47) strike a rather anomalous note. Here the poet personates a man whose life has been, like the lamp burning in a deserted abode, a thorough failure. Such a man is looking back on his youthful years of unmitigated worthlessness. But are the reflections he is making here typical of those who are at the threshold of true renunciation?  By no means are they typical. The poet here simply takes up a particular case of an aspirant after renunciation which may serve his poetical purposes best. This aspirant has had in his youth no taste of glory either as a pious man, a dutiful son, a scholarly student, a brave warrior, or a lover of women. He appears to lament here that none of the fourfold aim of human life (धर्म, religious merit; अर्थ, wealth; काम, fulfilment of desires; and मोक्ष, liberation) has been pursued by him in the past with the slightest success. Perhaps he means that that is best calculated to impress on his mind the vanity of all the ends of a householder’s life. But this impression of vanity and consequent non-attachment may very well come, and come with perhaps greater completeness, to men who had the ability to succeed in life, and such men may not at all look back with any lingering regret on enjoyments they are going to leave behind, whether their harvest had been actually reaped by them or not. There is even some incon­sistency in the ring of regret running through these stanzas. But the poet is here more concerned with dramatic effect than psycho­logical precision.]

			[The idea would come out more clearly, if we read, as many have done, क्लेशकलिलं and चिन्तामणिगुण:; the first expression would then mean ‘a (chaotic) mass of troubles’ instead of ‘hard to secure’, and the verb विशसि would have its primary sense of ‘entering into’. स्वयमुदितचिन्तामणिगुण: would then mean ‘having the virtue of a philosopher’s stone developed of itself in thee’—i.e., प्राप्ति:, one of the eight yogic powers. विविक्त: we prefer to render as ‘free from the company of others’—a state opposed to what is implied when we have to depend on others for gratifying our desires.]",167

			96. When accosted by people who loquaciously express doubt and surmise, such as, ‘Is he a Chandāla , or a twice born, or a Śūdra, or an ascetic, or perhaps some supreme yogī with his mind full of the discrimination of Reality,’ the yogīs themselves go their way, neither pleased nor displeased in mind.
			[The Chandāla is accursed beyond the pale of the four castes, while the Śūdra belongs to the fourth caste. The Brāhmana, Kṣatriya, and Vaiśya form the three twice-born castes.]",243

			97. (If) for serpents (even) air has been provided by the Creator as food obtainable without killing or toiling; (if) beasts are contented with feeding on grass-sprouts and lying on ground; for men (also) with intelligence strong enough to lead across the ocean of transmigratory existence, some such livelihood has been created; and those who seek this have all their guṇas invariably brought to their final dissolution.
			[When the guṇas—sattva, rajas, and tamas—are finally reduced to the inactivity of equipoise, the yogī reaches beyond māyā.
			The last line may also be interpreted differently—‘But in rummaging for it all one’s virtues are apt to come to an end.’]",352

			98. Will those happy days come to me when on the bank of the Gaṅgā, sitting in the lotus-posture on a piece of stone in the Himalayas, I shall fall into the yoga-nidrā (i.e., lose all consciousness in samādhi or perfect concen­tration) resulting from a regular practice of the contem­plation of Brahman, and when old antelopes having nothing to fear, will rub their limbs against my body!
            [पद्मासनम्— lit. lotus-seat; sitting cross-legged so that the soles of the feet protrude above along the thighs.]",239

			99. With the hand serving as sacred cup, with begged food that comes through wandering and never runs short, with the ten quarters as their ample garment and the earth as a fixed, spacious bed—blessed are they who, having forsaken the manifold worldly associations which an attitude of want breeds, and self-contented with a heart fully matured through their acceptance of absolute seclusion, root out all karma (i.e., the chain of cause and effect which grows on as action and desire in life follow each other).
			[दैन्यव्यतिकरनिकरा:—we prefer to take as: ‘the many forms of contact with the world which result from the poverty of an attitude of seeking worldly objects’.]",269

			100. O Earth, my mother! O Wind, my father! O Fire, my friend! O Water, my good relative! O sky, my brother! here is my last salutation to you with clasped hands! Having cast away infatuation with its wonderful power, by means of an amplitude of pure knowledge resplendent with merits developed through my association with you all, I now merge in Supreme Brahman.
			[The terms of familiarity and endearment used of the five elements are appropriate in view of the final point of blissful parting to which the yogī has been carried through those subtle tattvas or essences of the five elements which characterize intermediate stages of yogic practice.]",301

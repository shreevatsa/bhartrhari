"I

One walketh in Renunciation's way; 
Another fain would pay 
In Worldly Wisdom all his soul's large debt; 
And one in Pleasure's path 
With love still wandering on would all forget:—
Three roads the wide world hath.",K172?,
"II

In many a cavern on the wild hill-slopes 
That near to heaven climb,
By many a pool, dwell eremites with hopes
That laugh at measured time.

They lave in the cool Ganga where it flows
Over the level rocks;
They peer among the trees where Śiva goes
Tossing his matted locks;

They breathe in joy : but we — alas that fate 
Made woman's love so fair! 
For love restrains us in a world we hate, 
Cajoled by woman's snare.",K341?,
"III

Girls with the startled eyes of forest deer, 
And fluttering hands that drip 
With sandal-water; bathing-halls with clear 
Deep pools to float and dip;

The light moon blown across the shadowy hours,
Cool winds, and odorous flowers,
And the high terraced roof, — all things enhance
In Summer love's sweet trance.",K098,
"IV

This sodden air a needle scarce would prick; 
The wind dies in a gloom 
Of dripping leaves; and the low clouds with quick 
Reverberations boom.

Bewildered by heaven's fire I blindly grope
Through the chill Autumn storm,
To love's bright chamber, where one heart, I hope,
With summer still is warm.",,
"V

This Winter gale will play the gallant lover, 
And meeting careless girls 
Will pluck their gowns, and with rude fingers hover 
Among their tangled curls.

He'll kiss their eyelids too, their cheeks caress
Till they are all a-tremble;
He'll tease their lips till murmurs soft confess
The love they would dissemble.",K145,
"VI

’T is earth's Renewal : now the fluttering breeze,
Blown from the snowy hills
And filtered through the blooming mango trees,
The world with sweetness fills.

Now the mad bees are stung with brisk alarm;
And the wild cuckoos charm
The woods with singing, _Well! ah well! 't is well! 
We yield to Kāma's spell!_",K340,
"VII 

The silvery laughter; eyes that sparkle bold,
Or droop in virgin rue;
The prattling words of wonder uncontrolled 
When world and life are new;

The startled flight and dallying slow return,
And all their girlish sport; —
Ah me, that they time's ruinous truth must learn, 
Their flowering be so short!",,
"VIII 

Who hath escaped desire?
And thou, O King, — what profit in thy wealth
When Time with creeping stealth
Has quenched thy youth and covered o'er love's fire?

Nay, let us haunt the hall
Where loves forever call,
And girls with full-blown eyes like lotus flowers
Look laughing into ours,
Ere age and withering palsies blight us all.",,
"IX 

A flower whose fragrance none hath savored,
A singing bird no ear hath favored,
White pearl no jeweler hath bored, 
Untasted honey freshly stored
In a clean jar, unbroken fruit
That ripens now from virtue's root, —
Wondering I ask, O form unspotted,
To whose delight, sweet girl, thou art allotted ?",K203,
"X

My love within a forest walked alone, 
All in a moonlit dale; 
And here awhile she rested, weary grown,
And from her shoulders threw the wimpled veil
To court the little gale.

I peering through the thicket saw it all,
The yellow moonbeams fall,
I saw them mirrored from her bosom fly
Back to the moon on high.",K121,
"XI 

O fair Aśoka-tree, with love's own red
Thy boughs are all aflame;
Whither, I pray thee, hath my wanton fled? 
This way I know she came.

In vain thy nodding in the wind, thy sigh
Of ignorance assumed;
I know because my flower-love wandered by
For joy thy branches bloomed.

I know thee: ever with thy buds unblown,
Till touched by maiden's foot;
And thou so fair — one fairest maid alone
Hath trod upon thy root.",,
"XII 

Love's fruit in all the world is only this,
That two as one should think;
And they that disagree yet woo love's bliss,
Dead corpse with corpse would link.",K225,
"XIII 

Pluck the new - budding jasmine flower, and wreathe 
A garland for my brows;
Let saffron on my flesh and sandal breathe
Their perfume of carouse;
And then, O true love, lean upon my heart,
And all of heaven is there, or the best part.",,
"XIV 

Brightly the hearth-fire leap, and the lit lamp
Be burning clear and high ; 
Let sun or moon and starry hosts encamp 
With beacons in the sky : — 
Yet darkness in my heart and all is dark, 
Till I behold thine eyes and their love-spark.",K130,
"XV 

But to remember her my heart is sad, 
To see her is to know 
Bewildered thoughts, and touching driveth mad, 
How is she dear that worketh only woe?",K348,
"XVI 

A traveler pausing at the village well, 
His hollowed palms a cup, 
Bends down to drink, but caught as by a spell, 
With thirst unslaked looks up. 

And the fair keeper of the fountain stands,
Her girlish laughter stilled,
Nor careth from her urn into his hands
How thin a stream is spilled.",,
"XVII 

“Why, pretty fool, art thou so slender grown? 
Thou tremblest? and the prize 
Of all thy roses, whither is it flown?”

“My Lord, it meaneth nothing,” she replies, 
And smiles, — but when alone, 
Loosing the tears upgathered in her eyes,
Poor fool, she sighs and sighs.",,
"XVIII 

With one they laugh and chatter, yet beguile 
With luring eyes a second; 
A third they cherish in their heart the while, — 
Their true love who hath reckoned?",K247,
"XIX 

Now judge ye! — For a girl I walked forlorn
Who laughed my vows to scorn;
She loved another, who in coin repaid
Wooing a second maid.

And she, this second, making all complete,
Would worship at my feet. —
Four pretty fools and Kāma with his malice
Thus drove me from my palace.",K311,
"XX 

Harder than faces in a glass designed,
A woman's heart to bind ; 
Like mountain paths up cragged heights that twist, 
Her ways are lightly missed.

Like early dew-drops quivering on a leaf,
Her thoughts are idly brief;
And errors round her grow, as on a vine
The poison-tendrils twine.",K259,
"XXI 

The sportive Love-god in this worldly sea 
Angles continually; 
And women are his hook, their luring lips
The bait that bobs and dips.

We greedy fools, like silly nibbling fish,
Are landed with a swish;
And then, alack! to end the cruel game
Are broiled on love's quick flame.",K114,
"XXII 

O Wanderer Heart! avoid that haunted grove, 
The body of thy love;
Nor in her bosom stray, wild mountain fells
Where Love, the robber, dwells.",K104,
"XXIII 

Fair is her body as a lonely river
Whereon the moonbeams quiver;
About her waist three furrows in a row,
Like circling billows, go.

And there two swans their snowy plumage lave.
Soft riding on the wave;
There water-lilies nodding — 't is her brow,
A whiter flower. — O Thou

That shudderest in this sea of life to sink,
Beware that river-brink:
Lo, in the darkness, in the depths, there dwell
Monsters unnamable.",,
"XXIV 

In woman is the cause of shame, 
For woman burneth hatred's flame, 
Through woman in this body's snare 
The soul is mewed, — of woman, ah! beware.",,
"XXV 

Who reared this labyrinth of doubt, 
This leaguered town of reel and rout, 
This house of scandal? who hath sown 
These fields where noisome weeds spring up alone? 

This wizard's basket who hath stored
With all the conjurer's magic hoard
Of vain illusions ? — and the soul
But looking once forgets her blissful goal.

This barrier in the heavenly path,
This gateway to the pit of wrath,
Who made her then ? what hand perverse
Her moulded, man's inevitable curse?",,
"XXVI 

Communion with the good is friendship's root,
That dieth not until our death;
And on the boughs hang ever golden fruit : — 
And this is friendship, the world saith. 

Ourselves we doubt, our hearts we hardly know,
We lean for guidance on a friend;
Ay, on a righteous man we'd fain bestow
Our faith, and follow to the end.",,
"XXVII 

Like as the shadows of the twilight hour 
Differ from those at morn, 
So doth a good man's friendship in its power 
From that of evil born :— 
One small at first still stronger, deeper grows, 
One shortens to the close.",K062,
"XXVIII 

By truth the righteous guide upon his course
The rolling sun, and stay the earth by force
    Of penitence austere. 
They are the refuge of the worlds outworn,
And worlds that lurk in darkness still are born 
    Because they tarry here.",,
"XXIX 

A friend or stranger comes he? — so 
They reckon of the narrow mind; 
But some of broader reason know
In all the world one kith and kind.",K376,ayaṃ nijaḥ…
"XXX 

Lightly an ignorant boor is made content, 
And lightlier yet a sage;
But minds by half-way knowledge warped and bent, 
Not Brahma's self their fury may assuage.",K008,
"XXXI 

Oil from the sand a man may strain, 
If chance he squeeze with might and main; 
The pilgrim at the magic well
Of the mirage his desert thirst may quell.

So traveling far a man by luck
May find a hare horned like a buck; — 
But who by art may straighten out 
The crooked counsels of a stubborn lout?",K319,
"XXXII 

Better, I said, in trackless woods to roam
With chattering apes or the dumb grazing herds,
Than dwell with fools, though in a prince's home,
And bear the dropping of their ceaseless words.",K320,
"XXXIII 

The god hath wove for ignorance a cloak
That he who will may wear;
And mantled thus amid the wisest folk
Fools may unchallenged fare: —
Be silent ! over all that words afford,
Silence hath its reward.",K068,
"XXXIV 

I saw an ass who bore a load 
Of sandal wood along the road,
And almost with the burden bent,
Yet never guessed the sandal scent;
So pedants bear a ponderous mass
Of books they comprehend not, — like the ass.",,
"XXXV 

Wisdom acquire and knowledge hive, 
As thou a thousand years mightst thrive; 
For virtue toil with sleepless care, 
As Death already grasped thee by the hair.",,ajarāmaravat
"XXXVI 

Say thou what kindly is and truth, 
Say not the true that wakens ruth, 
Say not the kind that is not sooth. 

Yet rather silence were preferred, 
And second truth, and the law third, 
And only fourth the kindly word.",,satyam brūyāt… but what's the next 3 lines?
"XXXVII 

Where patience dwells what need of other shield?
Why prate of foemen when to wrath we yield? 
More warmth our kindred give than fires; and friends 
Far more than soothing herbs our wounds have healed. 

Why pray the gods whose heaven by love is wrought? 
Why slave for wealth when wisdom is unbought?
What pearls can modesty adorn? what gift 
Of kings add splendor to the poet's thought?",K237,
"XXXVIII 

One law there is: no deed perform
To others that to thee were harm; 
And this is all, all laws beside
With circumstances alter or abide.",,"śrūyatāṃ dharmasarvasvaṃ śrutvā caivāvadhāryatām |
ātmanaḥ pratikūlāni pareṣāṃ na samācaret ||

(?)"
"XXXIX 

Better from the sheer mountain-top 
Headlong thy ruined body drop; 
Better appease the serpent's ire 
With thy right hand; or in the fire
Behold thy riven members tost,
Than once thy mind's integrity were lost.",K322,
"XL 

This have I done, and that will do,
And this half-done must carry through
So busied, bustling, full of care,
Poor fools, Death pounces on us unaware.

To-day is thine, fulfill its work,
Let no loose hour her duty shirk;
Still ere thy task is done, comes Death,
The Finisher, — he ends it with thy breath.",,
"XLI 

Unworthy be the toil-polluted world of sense, 
Ay, hateful as the camping-ground of all offense; 
  Yet even in the truth-devoted heart, anon
Breaks forth its vast unnamed impetuous vehemence.",,
"XLII 

The rooted trees would walk; the beast 
For utterance yearning still is dumb; 
Man toils for some far heaven, wherefrom 
The enthronèd gods were fain released.",,
"XLIII 

Pleasure of life we have not known, 
Ourselves the sport of Fate alone; 
Penance of soul we never sought, 
But in our heart unbidden sorrows wrought. 

Time hath not journeyed, — nay,
But we are passing day by day;
And the desires that still their rage
Are not grown old — ourselves are chilled with age.",K155,
"XLIV 

For buried treasures earth I bored,
I smelted all a mountain's hoard,
I crossed the outrageous boisterous seas,
And for a king's content I sold my ease.

By night I haunted the foul tomb
With spells to waken from their doom
The sleepers. — Did I e'er succeed
A farthing ? — out upon thee, cursèd Greed!",K149,
"XLV 

O'er perilous mountain roads with pain 
I 've journeyed, yet acquired no gain; 
The pride of birth I have forsworn
And toiled in service, yet no profit borne.

In strange homes where I blushed to go
My food I've taken, like the crow,
And eaten shame. — Oh lust of gold! 
Oh Greed! that younger grow'st as I wax old!",K148,
"XLVI 

Read! — the Creator's finger on thy brow
Hath wrote the figure of thy wealth; nor thou
In lonely desert hid shalt make it less,
Nor greater on the Golden Mount possess.
What worry then? why in the crowded mart 
With vulgar traffic wear away thy heart?
The pitcher at the well is filled, nor more 
Draws at the ocean-shore.",K056,
"XLVII 

A captive snake half dead with fright 
Starved in a basket; till one night
A silly mouse, who roamed abroad,
A hole straight through the wicker gnawed,
And in his very gullet jumped.
The serpent felt his thin sides plumped,
Took cheer, and wriggled out in turn. —
Who knows all lucky falls in Fortune's urn?",K026,
"XLVIII 

An old man bald as a copper pot, 
Because one noon his head grew hot, 
Crawled to a spreading bilva-tree 
To seek the shade.  By Fate's decree 
A fruit just then came tumbling down,
And cracked the old man's brittle crown
With loud explosion — which was worse. —
Ill dogs us everywhere when Fate 's averse.",K039,
"XLIX 

I see a dog — no stone to shy at him; 
Yonder a stone — no dog's in view:
There is your dog, here stones to try at him —
The king's dog! what 's a man to do?",,शुनि दृष्टे न पाषाणः
"L

If the Creator moulding goodly man 
A pearl designed him to adorn the earth, 
And then so fragile made that at the birth 
It breaketh, — whose the folly of the plan?",,
"LI 

Rather this World forever as a wheel
Itself revolveth : sure, no guilty hand
Propelled it, nor shall any bid it stand,
Nor any wit a primal cause reveal. 

And thou, my Soul, the same unlaureled race
Art dragging on through weary change of form;
Nay, if to-day thou murmur in the storm,
Blame yesterday and choose to-morrow's place.",,
"LII 

Like as our outworn garments we discard,
And other new ones don;
So doth the Soul these bodies doff when marred, 
And others new put on.

Fire doth not kindle It, nor sword divides,
Nor winds nor waters harm;
Eternal and unchanged the One abides,
And smiles at all alarm.",,Gita
"LIII 

Like as a goldsmith beateth out his gold 
To other fashions fairer than the old, 
    So may the Spirit, learning ever more,
In ever nobler forms his life infold.",,
"LIV 

The harvest ripens as the seed was sown,
And he that scattered reaps alone; —
So from each deed there falls a germ
That shall in coming lives its source affirm.

Unseen they call it, for it lurks
The hidden spring of present works;
Unknown before, even as the fruit
Was undiscovered in the vital root.

And he that now impure hath been
Impure shall be, the clean be clean;
We wrestle in our present state
With bonds ourselves we forged, — and call it Fate.",,
"LV 

Before the Gods we bend in awe,
But lo, they bow to fate's dread law
Honor to Fate, then, austere lord!
But lo, it fashions but our works' reward.

Nay, if past works our present state
Engender, what of gods and fate?
Honor to Works! in them the power
Before whose awful nod even fate must cower.",K022,
"LVI 

These dear companionships are not forever;
The wheel of being without end 
Still whirls : if on the way some meet and sever, —
’T is brother, mother, father, friend.",,
"LVII 

Our little wit is all to blame, 
And separation's but a name; 
Else would our sorrow day by day
Grow deeper. — Lo, how swift it slips away!

For as a log at random tost
On the wide waves perchance is crost
Here by another drifting spar, —
So on this sea of life our meetings are.",,
"LVIII 

Wayfarers on the dusty road
By shaded wells their heavy load
Undoing rest awhile, and then
Pass on restored. — What cause of tears, O men?",,
"LIX 

Like as a dancing-girl to sound of lyres 
Delights the king and wakens sweet desires 
For one brief hour, and having shown her art
With lingering bow behind the scene retires: 

So o'er the Soul alluring Nature vaunts
Her lyric spell, and all her beauty flaunts;
And she, too, in her time withdrawing leaves
The Watcher to his peace — 't is all she wants.",,
"LX 

Now have I seen it all! the Watcher saith,
And wonders that the pageant lingereth:
And, He hath seen me! then the Other cries,
And wends her way: and this they call the Death. 

No more the Spirit feels, no more resolves;
Yet as the potter's wheel awhile revolves
After the potter's hand is still, awhile
The body draws the breath, and then dissolves.",,
"LXI 

I wonder that the wingèd soul 
Entered the body's hard control;
I wonder not when worn by age
The prisoned bird escapes the open cage.",,
"LXII 

While other birds at will may go 
Where the free winds of heaven blow, 
You, silly prattler, as the wage 
Of your sweet singing, languish in a cage.",,
"LXIII 

This World is blind to us that blinds the Soul ; 
We find Illusion lord of all its laws, 
We call our Ignorance its inner cause, 
And Knowledge trust to break its long control. 

Our Self we know, the knower and the known, 
We name it Soul, we worship it as God;
This Knowledge is the Lord, and at its nod
This We shall pass, and I remain alone.",,
"LXIV 

Here nothing is, and nothing there, 
And nothing fronts me wheresoe'er; 
And reckoning all I find the whole
Mere nothing, nothing — save the reckoning soul.",,
"LXV 

Seated within this body's car 
The silent Self is driven afar; 
And the five senses at the pole
Like steeds are tugging restive of control.

And if the driver lose his way,
Or the reins sunder, who can say
In what blind paths, what pits of fear
Will plunge the chargers in their mad career?

Drive well, O Mind, use all thy art,
Thou charioteer ! — O feeling Heart,
Be thou a bridle firm and strong!
For the Lord rideth and the way is long.",,
"LXVI 

HE, in that solitude before 
The world was, looked the wide void o'er
And nothing saw, and said, Lo I
Alone! — and still we echo the lone cry.

Thereat He feared, and still we fear
In solitude when naught is near:
And, Lo, He said, myself alone!
What cause of dread when second is not known?",,
"LXVII 

Alone each mortal first draws breath; 
Alone goes down the way of death; 
Alone he tastes the bitter food
Of evil deeds, alone the fruit of good.

They cast him in the earth away,
They leave him as a lump of clay,
They turn their faces, they are sped,
And only Virtue follows, — he is dead.

So garner Virtue till the end
As 't were our only guide and friend;
With it alone, when all is lost,
We cross the darkness, ah, so hardly crost.",,
"LXVIII 

Time is the root of all this earth;
These creatures, who from Time had birth,
Within his bosom at the end
Shall sleep ; Time hath nor enemy nor friend.

All we in one long caravan
Are journeying since the world began;
We know not whither, but we know
Time guideth at the front, and all must go.

Like as the wind upon the field
Bows every herb, and all must yield,
So we beneath Time's passing breath
Bow each in turn, — why tears for birth or death?",,
"LXIX 

A hundred years we barely keep,
Yet half of this is lost in sleep; 
And half our waking time we spend
In the child's folly and the old man's end.

And of the hours remaining, fears
And gaunt disease and parting tears
Are all the prize: — fie on the slave
Who life more values than a bubbling wave!",K200,
"LXX 

A while the helpless wailing child,
A while the youth by lusts denied,
A while for gold to cringe and swink,
A while to hear the yellow counters clink:

A while of lonely eld's disgrace,
The palsied limb and wizened face, — 
Then like the player he too creeps
Behind the heavy curtain — he too sleeps.",K235,
"LXXI 

Fallen our father, fallen who bore 
For us the pangs — they went before: 
And some with our years grew, but they, 
They too now tread on memory's dusty way. 

And we ourselves from morn to morn
Now shiver like old trees forlorn
Upon a sandy shore, and all
Our care the lapping waves that haste our fall.",K170,
"LXXII 

Old age like as a tiger held at bay
Still crouches ; sly diseases day by day
    Our leaguered body sap;
As water from a broken urn, so leak
Our wasting minutes ; — lo, this people seek
    Oblivion in love's lap.",K332,
"LXXIII 

Others for buried friends lament, 
Or sigh for wealth too quickly spent: 
Fret not, O King ; thy own grief call 
Part of the fatal grief that toucheth all.",,
"LXXIV 

When like an arrow in the dark 
Sorrow hath made our breast her mark, 
Piercing the mail 'twixt link and link, 
One balm there is, one salve: just not to think.",,
"LXXV 

Now Sorrow like a threefold chain 
Grapples our heart with triple pain: 
And one, the strongest bond I think,
Ourselves we forge and rivet link by link.

Another many-fingered Chance
Still weaves with daily circumstance;
And one some strange malignant Might
Drops clanking round us from an unknown height.",,
"LXXVI 

Dear brother, I have found the way
Though steep and narrow : and they say
Of old 't was trod by many a seer
Who knew his end and climbed from sphere to sphere.

Searching my heart I found the clue,
One truth though nothing else be true:
Sorrow within us and without,
And Sorrow nearer clinging when we doubt.

From yonder pure celestial height
Flooding our path a wondrous light
Pours on us; and where'er we go,
This haunting shadow of ourselves we throw.

So be it : if along the track
On Sorrow still we turn our back, 
We too may climb to that high doom
With light before us and behind the gloom.",,
"LXXVII 

Fear troubles pleasure lest it sap our health; 
Fear marreth beauty for the hideous stealth
Of love; fear prophesies to pride her fall;
Fear palsies strength, and warns the loss of wealth.

Fear poisons learning for another's fame;
Fear haunts the flesh with dissolution's shame;
Fear is to live ; — save when the soul withdrawn 
Looks out and laughs at the world's care and claim.",K294,
"LXXVIII 

All dearest things forsake us : — wealth is sped
To-day, or yet to-morrow love lies dead,
    Or hope fades in a year. 
Poor fools ! what matter when they go or how?
Poor fools ! that cling and will not leave them now, 
    Adding to loss a fear.
For if themselves they part what pangs they leave! 
Nay, fling them forth, and the soul's peace receive,
    Eternal now and here.",K157,
"LXXIX 

Life like the billow rolls, and youthful bloom 
Finds in a day its doom; 
Wealth fleeter is than fancy ; pleasure's lash 
Is but the lightning flash ; 
And these dear arms that hold our neck, beguile 
Ah, but a little while : — 
Rest then the heart in Brahma till we cross 
This sea of being where all errors toss.",K293?,
"LXXX 

Like an uneasy fool thou wanderest far 
Into the nether deeps, 
Or upward climbest where the dim-lit star 
Of utmost heaven sleeps. 

Through all the world thou rangest, O my soul,
Seeking and wilt not rest;
Behold, the peace of Brahma, and thy goal,
Hideth in thine own breast.",,
"LXXXI 

Idle thy wanderings, O my Heart! and all 
Thy labor vainly spent;
By weight of inner destiny doth befall
Or faileth each event.

Bear not the burthen of a world outworn,
Nor to the future bow;
With every hour thy joy be newly born,
And earth be new-created every morn, — 
Thy life is here and now.",,
"LXXXII 

No longer in this haunted jungle roam
With way-worn stumbling feet; 
Seek now the safer path that leadeth home,
Turn to thy last retreat.

Rest in the World's still heart; thy little cares 
Like wind-rocked billows roll, 
And all thy pleasure as the light wind fares; — 
Now give thee peace, my soul!",,
"LXXXIII 

Of old fair Learning served the wise to ward 
Time's grieving from the heart; 
Then to the worldly bowed her to afford 
The charms of sensual art; 
Now each new lordling of an ill-got field 
Disdains her; she must yield, 
And deeper hides and farther draws apart.",,
"LXXXIV 

Say not the words, “'T is I! 't is mine!”
They are the fatal seed 
Of future lives upspringing like a weed.

Say rather, “ 'Tis not I! not mine!”
New life from old desire
Still flames, — withhold the fuel, and where's the fire?",,
"LXXXV 

Before that peaceful Light whose form sublime 
Is purest thought uncurbed of space or time, 
Before that Light I bow, whose deathless source 
Is self-communing force.",,
"LXXXVI 

Within this body side by side 
Death and eternity abide; 
And death from error grows, but life
The spirit wrings from truth with hourly strife.",,
"LXXXVII 

The Seer enlightened lays apart
Follies that dizzy the child heart,
And upward turns his steps to climb
The terraced heights of Wisdom. There sublime

He stands and unperturbed looks down
Upon the far-off swarming town,
Sees the bent farmers till the soil
Like burrowing ants, and wonders at their toil.",,
"LXXXVIII 

One boasted: “Lo, the earth my bed,
This arm a pillow for my head,
The moon my lantern, and the sky
Stretched o'er me like a purple canopy.

“No slave-girls have I, but all night
The four winds fan my slumbers light.” — 
And I astonished : Like a lord
This beggar sleeps; what more could wealth afford?",K190,
"LXXXIX 

Are there no caverns in the mountains left? 
Are all the forest boughs of leaves bereft
And mellowing fruit? are the wild cataracts still 
On every lonely hill?

Why haunt the servile press? or cringe and bow 
To win the nod of some majestic brow
That wears for honor the low insolence
Of wealth — how got and whence?",K184,
"XC

Of old they say this holy Gangā stream
Rolled in the heavenly fields her crystal dream,
And thence by prayer of saintly men was led
To pour on Śiva's head.

Awhile within the great god's matted locks
She wandered, till the high Himalayan rocks
Received her thunderous fall; forever thence
Seaward she rolls immense.",,Similar to K334?
"XCI 

O World! I faint in this thy multitude
Of little things and their relentless feud;
No meaning have I found through all my days
In their fantastic maze.

O World! still through the hours of blissful night
The widowed moon her benison of light
Outpoureth, where the sacred river seems
From heaven to bear sweet dreams.

How soon, O World ! beside the Gangā shore
Through the long silent night shall I implore
The mystic name? how soon in Gangā's wave
My sin-stained body lave?",,

Is there no pleasure in these palace halls,
Where love invites and music ever calls?
No pleasure, when the revelers troop away,
If one, the loveliest, stay?

Yet have the prudent weighed the world as froth;
Lo, as a candle-flame by wing of moth
Is fluttered, so they count its fickle mood;
They turn to solitude.",K315,

Dear Heart, I go a journey, yet before
Would speak this counsel, for I come no more:
One love our life had, yet a greater still
The Spirit must fulfill.

Not now the wife is dear for love of wife.
But for the Self; and this our golden life
For life no more we treasure, it is dear
For that the Self dwells here.

And this beguiling world, the starry dome
Of purple and the gods who call it home,
Man, beast, and flowers that blow and blowing perish, 
Not for themselves we cherish,

But for the Self. And this is love, and they
Who look for other on the lonely way
Are still forsaken. — Tremble not, dear Hear!
Love stays though I depart.",,Yajnavalkya to Maitreyi?

Courage, my Soul! now to the silent wood
Alone we wander, there to seek our food
In the wild fruits, and woo our dreamless sleep
On soft boughs gathered deep.

There loud authority in folly bold,
And tongues that stammer with disease of gold,
And murmur of the windy world shall cease,
Nor echo through our peace.",,

These trodden lands are everywhere the haunt
Of wilder tribes than any crime may daunt;
And haply some malignant poison-barb
May pierce thy plumed garb.

O silly parrot, in the secret boughs
Where peril may not find thee, make thy house:
Come, cease thy prattle, seal thy mouth at length,
Silence is all thy strength.",,

Who is the Brahmin? — Not the mother's womb 
Declares him, nor the robes that all assume; 
But the true heart that never greed beguiles,
Nor turbid lust defiles.

Who is the Brahmin? — He who trembleth not
When snaps the cord that bound to human lot,
Who losing all is glad, whose peace is known
Unto himself alone.",,
"XCVII 

How slow to him who haunts preferment's door 
The long days drag! how lightly hurry o'er,
When the awakened soul hath thrown aside
Its load of worldly pride!

So, lying near my cavern's rocky ledge,
I 'd dream at ease upon the mountain edge;
And laugh a little in my heart, and then
Plunge into thought again.",K174,

Fire is the Brahmin's god; the seer
Knows in his heart the godhead near; 
Fools have their idol; but the clear
Untroubled vision sees him there and here.",,

Through many births, a ceaseless round, 
I ran in vain, nor ever found 
The Builder, though the house I saw, — 
For death is born again, and hard the law. 

O Builder, thou art seen! not so
Again thy building shall arise;
Broken are all its rafters, low
The turret of the mansion lies:
The mind in all-dissolving peace
Hath sunk, and out of craving found release.",,

O mother earth! O father air! O light,
My friend! O kindred water! and thou height
Of skies, my brother! — crying unto you,
Crying, I plead adieu.

Well have I wrought among you, — now the day
Of Wisdom dawning strikes old Error's sway,
And the light breaks, and the long-waiting soul
Greeteth her blissful goal.",K301,

  Whose essence is self-knowledge, Thee I call to bless my rhyme."
,,,On Fools
N002,यां चिन्तयामि,311,"  She whom I worship night and day, she loathes my very sight,
  And on my neighbour dotes, who in another takes delight;
  A third she in my humble self nothing but good can see:
  Now out upon the god of love, and him, and them, and me!"
N003,अज्ञः सुखमाराध्यः,8,"  Easy is a fool to manage, easier still a man of sense,
  Brahma's self is foiled by one of little brains and great pretence."
N004,प्रसह्य मणिमुद्धरेन्,9,"  Snatch a jewel, if it please you, from the tiger's ravening throat;
  Cross the ocean, though its billows toss in foamwreaths round your boat;
  Fearless twine an angry cobra like a garland round your head;
  But with fools forbear to argue,—better strive to wake the dead."
N005,लभेत सिकतासु,319,"  If you squeeze with might and main,
  Oil from sand you may obtain;
  If with parching thirst you burn,
  Some mirage may serve your turn;
  If you wander far and wide,
  Rabbits' horns may grace your side;
  But you'll never—trust my rule—
  Please a headstrong, bumptious fool."
N006,व्यालं बालमृणालतन्तुभिरसौ,67,"  As well attempt to pierce with flowers the diamond of the mine,
  As well attempt with honey-drops to sweeten ocean's brine,
  As well go bind with lotus-bands the lord of forest herds,
  As strive to lead in wisdom's ways the bad with sugared words."
N007,स्वायत्तमेकान्तहितं,68,"  When the Creator made the dolt,
  He left him not without his bolt;
  That fool shows best the wise among
  Who strokes his beard and holds his tongue."
N008,यदा किंचिज्ज्ञोऽहं,5,"  When but a little I had learned, in my own partial eyes
  I seemed a perfect Solon and immeasurably wise;
  But when a little higher I had climbed in wisdom's school,
  The fever-fit was over and I knew myself a fool."
N009,कृमिकुलचितं लालाक्लिन्नं,30,"  See that _pariah_ making off there with a filthy greasy bone,
  How he'll mumble and enjoy it when he finds himself alone!
  Not, if Indra's self reproved him, would he blush and leave his treat,
  For the mean abhor no meanness if it only yield them meat."
N010,शिरः शावं स्वर्गात्,334,"  From Heaven to Siva's head, and thence to Himalaya's snows,
  To India's plain, thence to the main, the sacred Ganges flows—
  A sad descent! hut rivers go astray, like foolish men,
  From heaven's crown they tumble down and never rise again."
N011,शक्यो वारयितुं,759,"  Water will serve to put out fire, umbrellas 'gainst the heat,
  A sharp hook guides the elephant, the ox and ass we beat,
  Disease we cure with doctor's stuff, the serpent's bite with charms,—
  Against the fool, the worst of ills, Nature provides no arms."
N012,साहित्यसंगीतकलाविहीनः,796,"  Deem him who verse and music scorns
  A beast without the tail and horns;
  What though he never feed on grass,
  I hold him none the less an ass."
N013,येषां न विद्या,697,"  Those slaves who neither fast nor give,
  Unjust, unthinking, idle live,
  Are beasts, though men by right of birth,
  Unwieldy burdens, cumbering earth."

  Than dwell in Indra's heavenly halls with brainless human shapes."

N015,शास्त्रोपस्कृत,13,"  Kings in whose country tuneful bards are found
  Naked and starving, though for lore renowned,
  Are voted dullards by all men of sense;
  Poets are ever lords, though short of pence,
  And he who spurns the diamond's flawless ray
  Himself degrades, not that he flings away."
N016,हर्तुर्याति न गोचरं,15,"  Those who possess that treasure which no thief can take away,
  Which, though on suppliants freely spent, increaseth day by day,
  A source of inward happiness which shall outlast the earth—
  To them e'en kings should yield the palm, and own their higher worth."
N017,अधिगतपरमार्थान्,16,"  Scorn not those sages who have scaled the topmost heights of truth;
      Who snap the cords of wealth like bonds of straw.
      For lotus-strings will never hold in awe
  Th' infuriate sovereign of the herd, drunk with the pride of youth."
N018,अम्भोजिनीवनविलासनिवासमेव,38,
N019,केयूरा न विभूषयन्ति,76,"  Neither rings, bright chains, nor bracelets, perfumes, flowers, nor well-trimmed hair,
  Grace a man like polished language, th' only jewel he should wear."
N020,विद्या नाम नरस्य,70,"  Knowledge is man's highest beauty, knowledge is his hidden treasure,
  Chief of earthly blessings, bringing calm contentment, fame, and pleasure;
  Friends in foreign lands procuring, love of mighty princes earning;
  Man is but a beast without it: such a glorious god is Learning."
N021,क्षान्तिश् चेत्,237,"  Better silence far than speaking,
  Worse are kinsmen oft than fire,
  There's no balm like friendly counsel,
  There's no enemy like ire,
  Rogues have keener teeth than vipers,
  Brains outweigh the miser's hoard,
  Better modesty than jewels,
  Tuneful lyre than kingly sword."
N022,दाक्षिण्यं स्वजने,71,"  Ever liberal to kinsmen, to the stranger ever kind,
  Ever stern to evil-doers, ever frank to men of mind,
  Ever loving to the virtuous, ever loyal to the crown,
  Ever brave against his foemen, ever honouring the gown,
  Womankind distrusting ever—such the hero I would see,—
  Such uphold the world in order; without them 't would cease to be."
N023,जाड्यं धियो हरति,42,"  What blessings flow from converse with the wise!
  All dulness leaves us, truth we learn to prize;
  Our hearts expand with consciousness of worth,
  Our minds enlarge, our glory fills the earth."
N024,जयन्ति ते सुकृतिनो,55,"  Those bards of passion who unfold
  The secrets of the heart,
  Their glory never groweth old,
  Nor feels Death's fatal dart."
N025,सूनुः सच्-चरितः,807,"  A duteous son, a virtuous wife, a lord to kindness prone,
  A loving friend, a kinsman true, a mind of cheerful tone,
  A handsome shape, a well-filled purse, a soul-illumined face,
  Are theirs on whom great Hari smiles, and sheds peculiar grace."
N026,प्राणाघातान् निवृत्तिः,3,"  Abstinence from sin of bloodshed, and from speech of others' wives,
  Truth and open-handed largess, love for men of holy lives,
  Freedom from desire and avarice,—such the path that leads to bliss,
  Path which every sect may travel, and the simple cannot miss."
N027,प्रारभ्यते न खलु,277,"  Cowards shrink from toil and peril,
  Vulgar souls attempt and fail;
  Men of mettle, nothing daunted,
  Persevere till they prevail."
N028,प्रिया न्याय्या,18,"  Not to swerve from truth or mercy, not for life to stoop to shame;
  From the poor no gifts accepting, nor from men of evil fame;
  Lofty faith and proud submission,—who on Fortune's giddy ledge
  Firm can tread this path of duty, narrow as the sabre's edge?"

N028~H,अथ मानशौर्यप्रशंसा |,,The Praise of Self-respect and Valour
N029,क्षुत्क्षामोऽपि जराकृशोऽपि,17,"  Worn with hunger, faint and feeble, shorn of glory and of power,
  Still the king of beasts is kingly, even to his dying hour;
  Will he graze on hay like oxen ? No, he longs to meet once more
  Tusk-armed elephants in battle, and to drink their spouting gore."
N030,स्वल्पं स्नायुवसावशेषमलिनं,350,"  Fling a dry and gristly cow's-bone to a low-bred cur to gnaw,
  Straight he wags his tail delighted, though it cannot fill his maw.
  Lions spare the prostrate jackal, but the forest monarchs smite,
  E'en by fortune pressed the valiant scorns to waive his proper right."
N031,लाङ्गूलचालनमधश् चरणावपातं,57,"  Dogs fawn on those who bring them meat,
  And grovel whimpering at their feet
  With upturned throat, and wag their tails in gamesome mood;
  But the huge elephant erect
  Bates not one jot of self-respect,
  And after thousand coaxings deigns to taste his food."
N032,परिवर्तिनि संसारे,74,"  In this revolving world the dead
    Are ever born again,
  But he is truly born whose race
    By him doth praise attain."
N033,कुसुमस्तबकस्येव,34,"  Two paths are open to the proud,
    As to the woodland flowers,
  Which flourish high above the crowd,
    Or wither in the bowers."
N034,सन्त्यन्येपि बृहस्पतिप्रभृतयः,53,"  Rahu spares the lesser planets
    As unworthy of his might,
  But he wreaks his lawful vengeance
    On the lords of day and night."
N035,वहति भुवनश्रेणीं,73,"  On his hood the serpent Sesha doth this triple world uphold,
  On the broad back of the tortoise he lies stretched in many a fold,
  On the ocean's breast the tortoise like a speck eludes the sight:
  Who in thought can limit greatness, or set bounds to Nature's might?"
N036,वरं पक्षच्छेदः,321,"  Better had the mount Mainaka borne the brunt of Indra's ire,
  Than thus plunged beneath the ocean severed from his sorrowing sire:
  Though he saved unharmed his pinions from the blazing thunder-stone,
  Yet he mourns amid the waters for his self-abandoned throne."
N037,यदचेतनोऽपि पादैः,65,"  The sun-gem touched by Heaven's rays,
  Though void of sense, is all ablaze;
  How then can men of spirit brook
  A fellow-mortal's scornful look?"
N038,सिंह : शिशुरपि,75,"  A lion's whelp will boldly face th' earth-shaking monarch's rage,
  For valour dwells in valourous kind, without regard of age."
N038~H,इति मानशौर्यप्रशंसा ।,,
,,,On Wealth
N039,जातिर्यातु रसातलं,25,"  Down to the lowest pit with rank, and gifts that all admire;
  Hurl virtue headlong from the steep, burn pedigrees with fire;
  On valour let the bolt descend: for wealth alone we pray,
  Without which noble qualities are vile as mouldy hay."
N040,तानीन्द्रियाणि,512,"  With mind and senses unimpaired,
    In act and voice the same,
  He moves among us like a ghost,
    Wealth's warmth has left his frame."
N041,यस्यास्ति वित्तं,51,"  The man of means is eloquent,
    Brave, handsome, noble, wise;
  All qualities with gold are sent,
    And vanish when it flies."
N042,दौर्मन्त्र्यान्नृपतिर्विनश्यति,23,"  The king by evil counsel falls,
    By worldliness the saint,
  Brahmans by want of sacred lore,
    Bad friends good manners taint;
  Indulgence spoils a son, and he
    Upon his race brings shame,
  Continual absence poisons love,
    Neglect cools friendship's flame;
  Carelessness ruins husbandry,
    Wrong saps a nation's health,
  Wine chases modesty, unthrift
    And largess squander wealth."
N043,दानं भोगो नाशस्तित्रो,50,"  Three courses open lie to wealth, to give, enjoy, or lose,
  Who shrinketh from the former two, perforce the third doth choose."
N044,मणिः शाणोलीढः,11,"  Less in size the polished jewel, but its rays far brighter gleam,
  Who regrets the dwindling sandbanks when boon autumn swells the stream?
  Glorious we hold the victor, though his life-blood gild the plain,
  Such the generous soul's undoing, that which seemeth loss is gain."
N045,परिक्षीणः कश्चित्स्पृहयति,12,"  Lo! the same man who longs for a handful of meal
    As a treasure of infinite worth,
  When his hunger is sated, esteems not a straw
    All the riches and glories of earth;
  Hence this moral we draw—in this transient world
    Nothing 's trifling or great in itself,
  'Tis the mind that projects its own hues on the mass,
    Now 'tis gold, now 'tis counted but pelf."
N046,राजन्दुधुक्षसि यदि,58,"  King, if thou wish the earth to yield to thee the milk of wealth,
  Cherish its offspring, let thy care be for thy people's health;
  For if thou watch to do them good with seldomsleeping eyes,
  Thy realms with golden fruits shall bloom like trees of Paradise."
N047,सत्यानृता च,59,"  Grasping and bountiful, cruel and kind,
  Savage and merciful, watchful and blind,
  Truthful and treacherous, policy's art
  Changeth its shape as an actress her part."
N048,आज्ञा कीर्तिः,66,"  Fame, might, the power to give and spend,
  To nourish Brahmans, help a friend,
  These blessings are a courtier's lot;
  What boots his toil who gains them not?"
N049,यद्धात्रा निजभालपट्टलिखितं,56,"  Fate writes upon thy brow at birth the limits of thy store,
  In barren wilds, on Meru's peak, 'tis neither less nor more;
  Then cringe thou not to wealthy men, but let thy looks be free,
  A pitcher from a pool is filled, as well as from the sea."
N050,त्वमेव चातकाधारोसीति,521,"  Well spake the _châtak_ to the cloud,
    "" By thee alone we live,
  This all men know, then why require
    Our prayers before thou give?"""
N051,रे रे चातक सावधानमनसा,721,"  O _châtak_, listen but a while, and to my speech give ear—
  Not all alike the clouds that on the face of heaven appear,
  Some fertilize the earth with showers, some fruitless thunders hurl:
  This lesson learn—a suppliant speech is wasted on the churl."
N051~H,अथ दुर्जनप्रशंसा |,,The description of the Wicked Man
N052,अकरुणत्वमकारणविग्रहः,61,"  A cruel mind intent on strife,
  Envying his neighbour's gold and wife,
  Hating the virtuous and his kin,
  Denotes and brands the man of sin."
N053,दुर्जनः परिहर्तव्यो,27,"  What though the scoundrel learned be, avoid him, cut him dead:
  Men shudder at the snake that wears a jewel in his head."
N054,जाड्यं हीमति गण्यते,24,"  The modest man's accounted dull, the pure a prudish knave,
  Th' austere a sour-faced hypocrite, the meek a heartless slave,
  The orator is tedious, the ascetic but a fool,
  The dignified is haughty, stolid and obtuse the cool,
  The hero savage; thus the bad do all things good despise,
  Each virtue with its kindred vice is tainted in their eyes."
N055,लोभश् चेदगुणेन किं,37,"  Treachery is of crimes the blackest,
    Avarice is a world of vice,
  Truth is nobler far than penance,
    Purity than sacrifice.
  Charity's the first of virtues,
    Dignity doth most adorn,
  Knowledge triumphs unassisted,
    Better death than public scorn."
N056,शशी दिवसधूसरो,10,"  The moon when dimmed by daylight, and a maid whose charms have fled,
  A lake with faded lotuses, a good man ill bested,
  A speechless mouth, a grasping king, a scoundrel in his train,
  Are seven thorns that fret my soul with neverending pain."
N057,न कश्चिच्चण्डकोपानामात्मीयो,60,"  I would not be the kinsman of a monarch prone to ire,
  Not e'en the sacrificing priest unharmed can touch the fire."
N058,मौनान्मूकः प्रवचनपटुचाटुलो,35,"  Not e'en a wonder-working saint
    Can hope to please the great,
  The silent man is said to sulk,
    The eloquent to prate,
  Patience is held but cowardice,
    Impatience disrespect,
  Officiousness is impudence,
    And modesty neglect."
N059,उद्भासिताखिलखलस्य,69,"  Those do not lead an easy life who fall into the power
  Of one in whom the seed of vice matures in perfect flower,
  Who with a herd of fawning rogues delights t' engird his throne,
  Whose lawless will no bonds of faith nor ties of blood doth own."
N060,आरम्भगुर्वी क्षयिणी क्रमेण,62,"  The kindness of the bad at first
    Is great, and then doth wane;
  The good man's love, at th' outset small,
    Slowly doth bulk attain;
  Such difference between these two
    In nature doth abide,
  As 'twixt the shadow of the morn
    And that of eventide."
N061,मृगमीनसज्जनानां,32,"  Hunters entrap the harmless deer,
    Fishers the finny brood,

  Who undisturbed their neighbours' wives
    And neighbours' merits view,
  Who firm on Siva fix their faith,
    And vain desires subdue!"
N063,विपदि धैर्यमथाभ्युदये,14,"  Firmness when fall'n on evil days, restraint when fortune smiles,
  Courage to look with steady eye on war's embattled files,
  Persuasive speech in council, and a burning thirst for fame,
  Joined with a love of holy writ, th' heroic soul proclaim."
N064,प्रदानं प्रच्छनं,275,"  Alms to bestow in secret, and the houseless wanderer feed,
  To hide one's own and loud proclaim another's kindly deed,
  Humbly to bear prosperity, and mourn with those who weep—
  Behold a vow which all the saints as yet have failed to keep!"
N065,करे श्लाघ्यस् त्यागः,72,"  Charity best adorns the hand
    And reverence the head,
  Truth is the virtue of the mouth
    In th' ears is scripture read,
  Valour lends glory to the arms,
    Contentment calms the heart,
  Thus lofty souls, though poor, are decked
    With grace in every part."
N066,संपत्सु महतां चित्तं,335,"  In times of joy the hero's soul
    Is soft as lotus-flower,
  But when misfortune's billows roll
    Stands stiff as granite tower."

  The same on lotus-leaflets hung like rows of diamonds gleam,
  In sea-shells, if Arcturus shine, they harden into pearl,—
  E'en so doth intercourse refine and elevate the churl."
N068,यः प्रीणयेत्सुचरितैः,279,"  He only can be called a son who gratifies his sire,
  She only is a wife who doth to please her lord aspire,
  He only is a friend who bides the same in weal and woe,—
  These blessings three the righteous gods on virtuous men bestow."

    Who rise by gentle arts,
  Who show their own heroic strain

  Who patiently reproaches bear,

  Who still to selfish ends prefer

    Clouds big with rain hang low,
  So good men humbly bear success,
    Nor overweening grow."
N071,श्रोत्रं श्रुतेनैव न कुण्डलेन,54,"  No earrings deck the good man's ears, which still on scripture feed;
  His hands, still open to the poor, no golden bracelets need;
  The perfume of his kindly acts, like flowers in leaves concealed,
  Exceeds the fragrant scent which nard and sandal unguents yield."

  Thy secrets hides, proclaims thy praise,
  With timely gifts relieves thy need,
  Thus may'st thou know the ""friend indeed."""

  The moon cheers up her favourite flower,
  The cloud unasked its rain bestows,
  Self-moved the good man's bounty flows."
N074,एके सत्पुरुषाः परार्थघटका,221,"  Some generous souls forbear their own, and seek another's gain;
  Most men, neglecting not their own, their neighbour's cause maintain;
  Those are mere demons who would build their wealth on other's loss,
  But what are those who profitless their neighbour's interest cross?"
N075,क्षीरेणात्मगतोदकाय,28,"  Milk to the water with it mixed its native virtues gave,
  Which, pitying sore its tortured friend, rushed on a flaming grave;
  The milk, unwilling to be left, must share its fellow's fate,—
  True friendship envy cannot reach, nor fiery pains abate!"
N076,इतः स्वपिति केशवः,20,"  Here Vishnu sleeps, and there his foes,
  Yonder the suppliant hills repose,

  Sometimes with simple herbs content, sometimes on dainties fed,
  One moment clothed in rags, anon ruffling in gallant show,

N114,उदन्वच्छन्ना भूः स च निधिरपां,219,"  The land is limited by sea, the sea its bounds must keep,

N115,एको देवः केशवो वा शिवो वा,223,"  Between Vishnu and Siva there's nothing to choose,

N120,दूरादर्थं घटयति नवं,260,"  Hard fate to minister and bard assigned,
  One must new turns and one new taxes find;

V058,एतस्माद्विरमेन्द्रियार्थ,180,"Be still, my fluttering heart, and leave this crowded show
Of worldly toys 'midst which thou eddiest to and fro,
Abandon fleeting forms, and seek that settled state
Of grounded peace enthroned above the storms of fate."
V059,पुण्यैर्मूलफलैः,181,"Pillowed on banks of moss, with roots and berries fed,
Enwound with strips of bark, our wants shall all be sped—
Off to the woodland shades, and gladly leave behind
These men of stammering speech, with wealth-bewildered mind."
V060,मोहं मार्जयतामुपाय,182,"Abandon empty hopes, and place thy trust, my breast,
In Ganga, and in him who bears the moony crest; 
Whoe'er confides in snakes, waves, women, bubbles, flames,
Lightnings or mountain streams, his want of sense proclaims."
V061,अग्रे गीतं सरसकवयः,183,"If song resound thy steps before,
    And Dekhan lyres behind,
And nymphs with jingling bracelets pour
    The _Chowri's_ perfumed wind,
Scorn not this world's broad easy ways.
    And drink of pleasure's bowl;
If not—then fix thy steadfast gaze
    On that undying soul."
V062,विरमत बुधा,326,
V063,प्राणाघातानिवृत्तिः,3,
V064,मातर्लक्ष्मि भजस्व,302,"Kind Fortune, seek some other love, I long not for thy dower;
And what to those whose lusts are dead avails thy golden shower?
Leave me to beg from day to day my dole of barley-meal, 
The fig's broad leaf supplies a dish that none would care to steal."
V065,यूयं वयं वयं,312,"Once I was thou, and thou wast I,
    In perfect union blent;
Say, what hath severed friendship's tie,
    And souls asunder rent ?"
V066,बाले लीलामुकुलितममी,282,"Why sidelong cast thy languid eyne?
Vain is thy hope to tangle mine.
My nature's changed; no more a child
With every wanton toy beguiled,
To cloistered cell I'd fain withdraw.
This world's bright nets I count but straw."
V067,इयं बाला मां,218,
V068,रम्यं हर्म्यतलं,315,"Tis sweet in palaces to dwell,
Where music's strains voluptuous swell;
'Tis sweet to hear the loved one's voice;
But wise men, of deliberate choice,
Have run from these to forest glades,
Assured all earthly pleasure fades,
Swift as the moth in heedless game
Puffs out the taper's feeble flame."
V069,किं कन्दा : कन्दरेभ्यः,184,"Are roots extinct in mountain caves? have streams forgot to flow?
Do vests of bark and woodland fruits on trees no longer grow?
Else why endure the haughty mien and eye-brows arched in scorn
Of men who've scraped together wealth to which they were not born ?"
V070,गङ्गातरङ्गकणशीकरशीतलानि,238,"Say, whither are those slabs of stone
    All moist with Ganga's dew.
And Dryad-haunted thickets flown,
    That men can bear to sue
For alms and insults at the door of some proud _parvenu_?"
V071,यदा मेरुः श्रीमान्निपतति,306,"Mount Meru's golden mass shall melt at that last awful day,
The monster-peopled seas dry up, the earth dissolve away;
What hope for feeble human frames, whose breath doth come and go,
As swiftly as the elephant flaps his ear to and fro?"
V072,एकाकी निस्पृहः,185,"When, when, O Siva, shall I be
Lonely and calm, from passion free;
My only robe the liberal air,
My hand the dish that holds my fare,
But able Action to uproot,
The tree that bears Life's bitter fruit."
V073,प्राप्ताः श्रियः,186,"Suppose thy fortune's boundless as the main,
Suppose thy years a world's great age complete,
Suppose thy foes all placed beneath thy feet,
And friends rewarded richly: where's thy gain?"
V074,जीर्णा कन्था ततः,288,"The hermit's tattered patchwork robe, or courtier's silken weeds.
One wife to tend thy home, or troops of elephants and steeds.
One simple meal at close of day, or many a gorgeous feast.
It matters not, be but thy soul from earthly cares released."
V075,भक्तिर्भवे मरणजन्मभयं,187,"My faith in Siva wavereth not, I shrink from future birth,
I care not for my friends or kin, I scorn the joys of earth,
I love the lonely forest-glades, from worldly turmoil free,
No greater bliss can fall to man than falleth unto me."
V076,तस्मादनम्तमजरं,188,"Think upon that self-developed, everlasting One Supreme,
Fling aside all vain delusions, all the worldling's baseless dream,
Pity those dull slaves of custom who are caught with empty toys,
Kingly crowns, and thrones imperial, and a round of sensual joys."
V077,पातालमाविशति,189,"You mount to heaven, again you sink to hell,
    You roam the world around with anxious breast,
And yet not e'en by chance your thought doth dwell
    On Him who only gives the spirit rest."
V078,रात्रिः सैव पुनः,316,"Night follows night, and day succeedeth day,
And thoughtless men hurry to work and play,
But sages ought to blush when treading found,
Year after year, the same dull weary round."
V079,मही रम्या शय्या,190,"Stretched out at ease upon the ground, and pillowed on his arm,
The houseless hermit sleeps in peace, secure from nightly harm,
The breeze his fan, his lamp the moon, his canopy the sky, —
What royal palace of this earth can such delights supply?"
V080,त्रैलोक्याधिपतित्वमेव,254,"Feasts, flatteries, and idle hours
    Make up a prince's day,
Let not the saint employ his powers
    To compass kingly sway:
But quaff the ever-brimming stream
    Of pure and holy mirth;
Who that hath tasted bliss supreme
    Can sink to joys of earth?"
V081,किं वेदैः स्मृतिभिः,191,"What profit are the Vedas,
Or books of legal lore,
Or those long-winded legends.
Repeated o'er and o'er?
What gain we by our merits?
A dwelling in the skies—
A miserable mansion,
That men of sense despise—
All these are huckstering methods, —
Give me that perfect way
Of self-contained fruition,
Where pain is done away."
V082,आयु : कल्लोललोलं,192,"Our life is like th' unstable wave,
Our bloom of youth decays.
Our joys are brief as lightning flash
In summer's cloudy days,
Our riches fleet as swift as thought;
Faith in the One Supreme
Alone will bear us o'er the gulfs
Of Being's stormy stream."
V083,ब्रह्माण्डमण्डलीमावं,284,"Can all this earth encloses
Flutter the sage's breast?
Say, can the darting minnow
Trouble the ocean's rest?"
V084,यदासीदज्ञानं,6,
V085,रम्याश्चन्द्रमरीचयस्तृणवती,193,"I love the moon's soft beams, I love the grassy wood,
I love to talk of verse among the wise and good,
I love the fair one's face gleaming with angry tears,
I think how fleeting all, and pleasure disappears."
V086,भिक्षाशी जनमध्यसङ्गरहितः,289,"Lonely among his kind,
Breaking on alms his fast,
Free as th' unfettered wind,
The hermit wanders past,
Of tattered rags his dress,
He knows no care nor pride,
He longs for quietness,
And has no want beside."
V087,मातर्मेदिनि तात मारुत,301,"My mother Earth,
My kinsman Fire,
Water my friend,
And Wind my sire.
My brother Heaven,
A long adieu!
By merit gained
When linked to you
I've purchased grace
To break my chains,
And merge in that
Which all sustains."
V088,यावत्स्वस्थमिदं,194,"While the soul's temple still stands firm, and eld still bides afar,
While sense is keen, and Life with Death still wages equal war.
The wise to gain the spirit's peace should strive with strong desire.
What boots to dig a well when all the house is wrapped in fire?"
V089,नाभ्यस्ता भुवि,195,"I have not learnt the wrangler's art or less pretentious lore,
Nor cleft in fight the war-beasts' skulls on Fame's broad wings to soar,
Nor sipped the fair one's honeyed lip while soft the moonbeam falls;—
My youth is wasted like a lamp in vast unpeopled halls."
V090,ज्ञानं सतां मानमदादिनाशनं,250,"Knowledge abates the wise man's pride,
But kindles it in all beside;
That loneliness which shields the saint
Lets sinners sin without restraint."
V091,जीर्णा एव मनोरथाः,249,"The youthful freshness of my heart is worn with old decay,
The beauty of my limbs hath passed unrecognized away,
Grim Fate brings nigh with giant strides the unrelenting hour;
What hope but in the feet of him who smote Love's wanton power?"
V092,तृषा शुष्यत्यास्ये,253,"If parching thirst dries up the throat,
How sweet the brimming stream;
If hunger pinches, rice and herbs
Imperial dainties seem.
We hug this fond belief,—that we
A solid pleasure gain,
When all we've done is to remove
The momentary pain."
V093,स्नात्वा गाङ्गैः,345,"When shall I bathe in Ganga's stream and please Thee, Lord, with fruits and flowers,
Thinking of that one worthy theme, on beds of stone through midnight hours,
Honouring my Father in the faith, striving to lift my heart above?
When shall I fling my woes aside? Help me, thou enemy of Love."
V094,शय्या शैलशिला,333,"The man whose bed is made of rock, whose mansion's but a cave,
Who's clothed in bark and fed on fruits, who drinks the crystal wave,
Whose friends are deer, alone can boast of splendour on this earth;
For he alone ne'er bows the head to power, or wealth, or birth."
V095,सत्यामेव त्रिलोकीसरिति,339,
V096,उद्यानेषु विचित्रभोजन,430,"Out of Banaras who can live that boasts the sage's name,
Where rags are counted splendid clothes, and begging held no blame,
Where gardens yield to all who need their bounteous supplies,
Where saints subdue the flesh, where Death's the gate of Paradise?"
V097,नायं ते समयो,264,"Leave those proud doors where surly slaves growl out ""our lord's asleep,
We cannot wake him: if we do, his wrath no bounds will keep,""
But haunt the temple of that god who rules this mighty whole,
Whose gate no ill-bred porter keeps, who fills with bliss the soul."
V098,प्रियसखि,278,"Our mind is but a lump of clay
That Fate, grim potter, holds
On sorrow's wheel that rolls alway,
And, as he pleases, moulds."
V099,महेश्वरे वा जगतामधीश्वरे,300,"Siva controls earth, heav'n, and hell,
Vishnu pervades each part,
Their rank in being who can tell?
But Siva has my heart."
V100,रे कन्दर्प करं,317,"Why, Cupid, wound thy hand with twanging still the bow?
Why, cuckoo, sound for nought thy soft love-moving strain?
Why bashful maiden, still thy sidelong glances throw?
My soul the nectarous wine of Siva's love doth drain."
V101,कौपीनं शतखण्डजर्जरतरं,234,"What though the hermit's cloak be torn with many a rent,
What though he sleep in tombs or under forest trees,
Heeding not friend or foe, on self-communion bent,
From pride and anger free, his mind is still at ease."
V102,भोगा भङ्गुरवृत्तपो,292,"Enjoyments quickly lose their zest; of them our life is made;
Then why extend the hand to grasp these flowers that bloom to fade?
If for my words you care at all, then fix your constant soul
On that eternal Fount of light whose beams can Love control."
V103,धन्यानां गिरिकन्दरे,196,"Happy who dwell in mountain caves, praising the One Supreme,
Upon whose breasts sleep fearless birds that drink their tears of joy,
While we are sporting in the groves, and wandering by the stream
Of some aerial pleasure ground, our wayward fancy's toy."
V104,आघ्रातं मरणेन जन्म,197,"Death swallows Birth, and Youth's brief flash the jaws of Age devour,
Desire of wealth eats up Content, and Love the peaceful hour,
Fell Envy's tooth gnaws Virtue's bud, and snakes infest the wood,
Kings' courts are overrun with knaves: thus bad things feed on good."
V105,आधिव्याधिशतैर्जनस्य,198,"Hundreds of various pains and griefs uproot the health of man,
Where Fortune takes up her abode mishaps soon crowd the gate,
Nothing is born which Death makes not a subject of his state,
How full of faults is Destiny! how ill-conceived her plan!"
V106,कृच्छ्रणामेव्यमध्ये,199,"Hard is our lot within th' imprisoning womb,
Our youth beset with separation's doom,
Loathsome our age, the theme of woman's mirth,
Say then, ye men, what joy ye find on earth?"
V107,आयुर्वेर्षशतं नृणां,200,"A hundred years complete our span, half that is passed in night:
Childhood and age devour the half of what belongs to light:
The rest is torn with parting pangs, of ceaseless toil the slave;
What profit in our human life, unstable as the wave?"
V108,ब्रह्मज्ञानविवेकिनोमलधियः,283,"Those who distinguish that which is from fleeting outward shows,
Do well to give up wealth and joys to gain secure repose;
What therefore must be said of us who cannot bear to part
From that which never can be ours, on which we've set our heart?"
V109,व्याघ्रीव तिष्ठति जरा,332,"Eld like a tiger threats our careless bliss,
Diseases wound our frame like angry foes,
As water from a broken pitcher, flows
Our life away; and yet men do amiss."
V110,सृजति तावदशेषगुणाकरं,342,"Once in a way Dame Nature makes
A perfect crystal free from stain,
And then, like careless workman, breaks
The piece which cost her so much pain."
V111,गात्रं संकुचितं,242,"The limbs contract, the gait's infirm, the teeth drop from the gums,
The eyesight dims, the hearing fails, and senile drivelling comes;
No more relations heed our words, our wife e'en disobeys,
Our son becomes a foe: alas! what ills in length of days!"
V112,क्षणं बालो,235,"Man is an actor who plays various parts:—
First comes a boy, then out a lover starts,
His garb is changed for, lo! the beggar's rags!
Then he's a merchant with full money-bags;
Anon an aged sire, wrinkled and lean;
At last death drops his curtain on the scene."
V113,अहौ वा हारे वा,213,"Night, day, friend, foe, dross, gems, are all the same to me,
'Twixt stones and rose-strewn beds no difference I see;
In some lone hermitage I let the hours glide by,
And loud on Siva call with thrice-repeated cry."

Who nought possessing, nought desires,
Nor burns with passion's raging fires,
Finds happiness from pole to pole."
V115,अनावर्ती कालो,204,"Time passes never to recede,
But careless mortals take no heed:
The woes that in past years we bore
Leave us no wiser than before;
What folly do we lay aside?
Though sorely by our errors tried,
We learn not prudence, but begin
Once more a fresh career of sin."
V116,अभिमतमहामानग्रन्थिप्रभेदपटीयसी,207,"The belly clamours for its rights, and will not be denied,
Its keen-set longings cut the purse that holds our human pride,
It withers virtue as the moon the lotus of the day,
The mantling vine of modesty it lops and shreds away."
V117,अश्नीमहि वयं,210,"Let's live on offerings, sleeping on the ground,
Clothed with the air, and not in courts be found."
V118,उत्तिष्ठ क्षणमेकमुद्रह,422,"“Rise up and bear one second's space
Grim penury's awful load;
Let me o'erwearied take thy place
In Pluto's dark abode.”—
A poor man thus a corpse bespake;
The corpse, preferring death
To want, would not its silence break
For all his waste of breath."

Though linked to Uma's form by everlasting ties;
We, racked with venom-pangs which Cupid's arrow brings,
Can neither leave nor yet enjoy these worldly things."
V122,एता इसन्ति च रुदन्ति च,439,"They smile and weep to gain their end,
Cajole, but never trust a friend,

Shunning them like the funeral jar."

Of what consists our life, of bitter or of sweet?"

V130,वेतश्चिन्तय मा रमां,245,"My soul, for Fortune sigh no more, that blind capricious fair,
That dwells in princes' nods and frowns, unstable as the air;

Dead to all useful purposes e'en from their birth remain."
V132,तुझं वेश्म सुताः,252,"“My house is high, my sons renowned, my wealth beyond compare,

Can win through toil and strife
To that supreme delight."
V139,पातालान विमोचितो,599,"Bali you've not released from hell nor Death the monster slain,

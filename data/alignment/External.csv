My parents died
  many years ago.
Childhood friends live on
  only in my memory.
Any day now
  you will hear the news
    of my passing.
I am like an old tree
  living by a river,
my weak roots
  clinging
    to the crumbling,
      sandy bank.  ",K170

Thinking I enjoyed the pleasures of life
I myself was enjoyed by life.

Thinking I didn't need to burn off my sins,
I myself was burnt up.

Thinking that I passed the time,
I myself was passing on.

Greed didn't grow old & leave my body,
I myself grew old.",K155

                The maid my true heart loves would not my true love be;
                She seeks another man; another maid loves he;
                And me another maid her own true love would see:
                Oh, fie on her and him and Love and HER and me!

                WOMEN'S EYES

                The world is full of women's eyes,
                Defiant, filled with shy surprise,
                Demure, a little overfree,
                Or simply sparkling roguishly;
                It seems a gorgeous lily-bed,
                Whichever way I turn my head.

                  For all the money-kings.

                My limbs are sadly feeble grown, and old:

                The sum was great perhaps, or small; yet now

                  Thou shalt have nothing less than his decree;
                Nor shall a single penny more be found,

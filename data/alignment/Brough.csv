4,"A man lives long who lives a hundred years: 
Yet half is sleep, and half the rest again 
Old age and childhood. For the rest, a man 
Lives close companion to disease and tears, 
Losing his love, working for other men. 
Where can joy find a space in this short span? ",200
8,"No single plant in this world’s garden-plot 
Bears such sweet fruit, such bitter fruit as she: 
Ambrosial are the apples on her tree 
When she’s in love, and poison when she’s not.",91
9,"You cheat yourself and others with your lies. 
  Philosopher, so foolish-wise, 
    In that you state 
      A celibate 
  Has greater grace to win the prize. 
Are there not heavenly nymphs beyond the skies?",120
11,"Upwards, thick cloud-tresses, and below them 
  the mountain-slopes where the peacock plays; 
See, on the ground snow flower-petal whiteness: 
  where shall the traveller rest his gaze?",87
12,"The clear bright flame of man’s discernment dies 
When a girl clouds it with her lamp-black eyes.",77
13,"Her face is not the moon, nor are her eyes 
Twin lotuses, nor are her arms pure gold: 
She’s flesh and bone. What lies the poets told! 
Ah, but we love her, we believe the lies. ",108
14,"If the forest of her hair 
Calls you to explore the land, 
And her breasts, those mountains fair,
Tempt that mountaineer, your hand –
  Stop! before it is too late:
  Love, the brigand, lies in wait.",104
15,"She needeth no instruction in the art
Of using woman’s wiles to win man’s heart:
The lily’s scarlet stamens grew untaught,
The bee came freely, wishing to be caught.",82
17,"In former days we’d both agree
That you were me, and I was you.
What has now happened to us two,
That you are you, and I am me?",312
18,"This is the truth, good people, and no lie.
Why should I lie? In heaven, and earth, and hell,
_Womman is mannes blis and al his joye:_
  Womman is mannes onlie grief as wel.",81
20,"Love goes a-fishing with the rod Desire, 
Baiting his hook with Woman for delight.
Attracted by the flesh, the men-fish bite.
He hauls them in and cooks them in his fire.",114
23,"Granted her breasts are firm, her face entrancing, 
Her legs enchanting - what is that to you? 
My mind, if you would win her, stop romancing. 
Have you not heard, reward is virtue’s due?",136
26,"No, but look here now, this is just absurd. 
The way our famous poets talk of girls 
As weak and winsome. Weak? Is this a word 
To use of those who, with a shake of curls 
And with the triumph of a modest glance,
Can lead the very gods a merry dance?",118
27,"On sunny days there in the shade 
Beneath the trees reclined a maid 
Who lifted up her dress (she said) 
To keep the moonbeams off her head.",121
28,"Of Amor is yone hure ane altir fyre 
Quhair passioun ay kyndillis het desyre, 
That yhongis thair evir sacrifices heilth
Offrand oblacioun of yewth and weilth.",110
47,"Although I have a lamp, and fire. 
Stars, moon, and sun to give me light. 
Unless I look into her eyes, 
All is black night.",130
49,"The pleasant city and its mighty king,
The tributary princes at his side,
The learned men that were the kingdom’s ride,
The minstrels with a ready song to sing.
The gracious ladies of the court, the ring
Of haughty nobles, arrogant of birth.
Are conquered by the Lord of all the earth,
Time, who makes memories of everything.",169
57,"Eild has my eyne clokit in darknes.
My fors is failyeit in distres
And feblit with infermite:
  This warld is verray vanite.
Sen Deid hes all my brether tane.
In this warld I man lif alane: 
Thocht plesour mair I myght nat se, 
  _Timor mortis conturbat me._",153
64,"‘Stop but a moment, friend, and rise and carry 
The burden of my weary poverty’
But the dead man, who would not change his peace
For poverty, said nothing in reply. ",422
66,"The noble man works for another’s good. 
Sacrificing his own. Most common men
Will help another, if it’s understood
That nothing of their own is thereby lost. 
Devils incarnate we can comprehend, 
Those who wax fat while others bear the cost. 
But are there wretches who would harm a friend 
And neighbour without any hope of gain?",221
70,"Patience, better than armour, guards from harm. 
And why seek enemies, if you have anger?
With friends, you need no medicine for danger.
With kinsmen, why ask fire to keep you warm?
What use are snakes when slander sharper stings?
What use is wealth where wisdom brings content?
With modesty, what need for ornament?
With poetry’s Muse, why should we envy kings?",237
71,"      Deer and fish and good men live
    On grass and water and content:
  No cause for hatred do they ever give
To hunters, fishers, or to men malevolent.",32
73,"Trees bend when the fruit swells. 
With fresh rains, the clouds droop low. 
Good men are not made proud by wealth. 
They cannot act otherwise: 
It is their nature to bring help to others.",63
74,"Seeking shelter from the sun, 
A bald man sat beneath a Bilva-tree. 
A fruit fell down 
And cracked his crown. 
It often happens that an unfortunate man is followed by 
misfortunes wherever he goes.",39
75,"Prince, would you milk this bounteous cow, the State? 
First, you must let the People drink their share: 
Only when calves are fed, will Earth’s tree bear 
Fruit, like a cornucopia, for your plate.",58
76,"When I knew a little, then I was like an elephant blinded with rut, and my mind was infected by the pride of omniscience: but when from wise men I learned and understood a little here and a little there, then I knew I was a fool, and my pride vanished like a fever cured.",5
97,"Good noble men, after a fall 
  Bounce like a ball. 
Th' ignoble fall another way: 
  Like lumps of clay.",276
101,"A man who has the world for his wide bed.
His arm for pillow and the sky for tent.
The pleasant wind to fan him, overhead
Bright moon for lamplight, and his calm content
His consort - were it not he lacked one thing,
Life’s anxious fear, would sleep like any king.",190
109,"The sun and moon, for all their light,
Have little reason to be proud.
When he by day and she by night
Share the same ragged patch of cloud.",313
114,"My best respects to Poverty, 
The master who has set me free: 
For I can look at all the world. 
And no-one looks at me.",718
115,"‘The night will pass soon, and the dawn will come.
The sun will soon rise, and the lotus open.’
But while the bee dreamt, caught within the blossom, 
An elephant uprooted the lotus-plant.",712
117,"Rags are enough for me, silk pleases you: 
A difference undifferentiated. 
A man is poor till his desires are sated. 
Who is the rich, who poor, between us two?",177
122,"To be apart
From you, sweetheart.
May yet be best.
One thing I see 
When you’re with me,
A single face: 
From all things - one.
When you are gone, 
I see your grace 
In all the rest.

(Or, if the reader prefers a different style:) 

Pure logic may convince a lover’s heart
That ampler blessings flow when we’re apart.
When she is here, my lady is but one:
When she’s away, in all things I see her alone.",770
126,"Water to quench a blaze. 
Shade to keep off the sun’s fierce light. 
Goad for the elephant in rut. 
Stick for the ox and mule. 
Herbs to subdue disease. 
Spells for the poison serpent’s bite - 
All things else have an antidote: 
Nothing can cure a fool. ",759
128,"You are the king: we too are highly placed. 
Honoured for the deep wisdom we command. 
You are praised for your riches: poets sing 
Our fame in every comer of the land. 
Thus no great difference lies between yourself 
And us. - And, sire, if you despise our state, 
We for our part care naught for anything.",163
129,"I am no actor, nor a prince’s jester.
No king’s musician, nor a scheming courtier. 
What place at court, then, for a man such as I am? 
For neither am I a young attractive woman.",165
130,"There are men brave enough to face and slay 
A wild rogue elephant, or a hungry Hon. 
But – I will tell such heroes to their face –
Few men, for all their strength, can break Love’s pride. ",296
131,"She who is always in my thoughts prefers
Another man, and does not think of me.
Yet he seeks for another’s love, not hers; 
And some poor girl is grieving for my sake. 
Why then, the devil take 
Both her and him; and love; and her; and me.",311
141,"The pieces move, now few, now more: 
Here many, where before was one. 
Here none, where many stood before. 
Time, with the goddess Death at play, 
Sits at the chequer-board and rolls 
Alternate dice of night and day. 
And takes the pieces: living souls 
Of all that dwell beneath the sun.",171
153,"The ignorant are quickly satisfied, 
And argument will soon convince the wise; 
But Heaven’s own wisdom scarcely will suffice 
To contradict a half-baked scholar’s pride.",8
154,"If only you squeeze hard enough, you will 
Press oil from sand; 
And, if you’re thirsty, even drink your fill 
From a mirage. 
Sooner or later you may somewhere find 
A rabbit’s horn: 
But never hope to change the stubborn mind 
Of a born fool.",319
154,"If you can snatch the jewel a crocodile 
Holds in its teeth, 
If you can swim across the ocean, while 
The tempest roars.
If round your head, unruffled, you can wind 
A poison snake,
You still can’t hope to change the stubborn mind 
Of a born fool.",9
163,"A chance swift glance;
Her eyebrow bow with casual cunning bended;
Words’ witching spell; 
Laughter, fading in maiden modesty; 
Unstudied stance; 
Cool graceful steps wherein love’s fire is blended: 
Woman knows well 
These are her ornaments, her armoury.",92
164,"No more evasions, please. Consider well 
The facts, and tell where best to seek for rest: 
At court, or exiled where flanked mountains swell?
Or in her smile, reclining on her breast?",84
166,"In this vain world, when men of intellect
Must soil their souls with service, to expect
A morsel at a worthless prince’s gate,
How could they ever hope to renovate
Their spirits? - were it not that fate supplies
The swinging girdles and the lotus eyes -
Women, with swelling breasts that comfort soon,
Wearing the beauty of the rising moon.",97
167,"In this vain fleeting universe, a man 
Of wisdom has two courses: first, he can 
Direct his time to pray, to save his soul. 
And wallow in religion’s nectar-bowl; 
But, if he cannot, it is surely best 
To touch and hold a lovely woman’s breast. 
And to caress her warm round hips, and thighs, 
And to possess that which between them lies.",88
168,"‘No! don’t!’ she says at first, while she despises
The very thought of love; then she reveals
A small desire; and passion soon arises,
Shyly at first, but in the end she yields.
With confidence then playing without measure
Love’s secret game, at last no more afraid
She spreads her legs wide in her boundless pleasure.
Ah! love is lovely with a lovely maid!",124
193,"Surely the god of love became her willing slave. 
Obedient to the orders that her glances gave.",127
235,"Earth, my own mother; father Air; and Fire, 
My friend; and Water, well-beloved cousin; 
And Ether, brother mine: to all of you
This is my last farewell. I give you thanks
For all the benefits you have conferred
During my sojourn with you. Now my soul
Has won clear, certain knowledge, and returns
To the great Absolute from whence it came.",301
257,"For one short act, a child; next act, a boy 
In love; then poor; a short act to enjoy 
Status and wealth: till in the last act, Man, 
Painted with wrinkles, body bent with age, 
Ending the comedy which birth began, 
Withdraws behind the curtain of life’s stage. ",235

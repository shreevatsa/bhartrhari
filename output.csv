                And when the rainy days are come,
                Your lady-love must stay at home;
                She clings to you, a little bold
                Because she shivers with the cold;
                The breeze is fresh with heaven's spray
                And drives her lassitude away:
                When happy lovers are together,
                The rainy time is fairest weather.

17. Among sensual persons, Śiva  is unique, sharing half His body with His beloved; and again, among the dispassionate, there is none superior to Him, unattached to the company of women; while the rest of mankind, smitten and stupefied by the irresistible, serpent-like poisoned arrows of Cupid, and brought under the infatuation of Love, can neither enjoy their desires nor renounce them at will.
[प्रियतमादेहार्धहारी —This refers to the symbolic representation of Śiva and Gaurī in a single divided form.
                        On one side grows the hair in long and black curls,
                        And on the other, corded like rope;
                        One side is white with ashes, like the snow-mountains,
                        The other golden as the light of the dawn.
                        For He, the Lord, took a form,
                        And that was a divided form,
                        Half-woman and half-man.
भोक्तुं न मोक्तुं क्षम: —Ordinary persons, when they give them­selves up to enjoyments, lose all control and become slaves to them; so even when satiety comes, they cannot detach themselves from them, as the force of blind attachment has enslaved them. But Śiva, who has subdued His mind, is unaffected by them, as in His state of mental poise of yoga, pleasure and pain are the same to Him.]",https://calm-gaufre-6360e8.netlify.app/gopinath/1896-XikpAAAAYAAJ/pdf/images-300/p-280.jpg,https://calm-gaufre-6360e8.netlify.app/gopinath/1914-VeBjAAAAMAAJ/pdf/images-300/p-274.jpg,211,,,"

                And so my poems died.              
            ",140,"  Envy possesses those that know,
    Great men are drunk with pride,
  The vulgar no discernment show;
    Who shall for bards provide?"

11. I do not find the virtuous distinction produced (by ceremonial observances) through life after life to be conducive to well-being, for the sum of such virtuous merits when weighed in mind inspires fear in me. Enjoyments earned by great accession of merit, multiply so greatly in the case of people attached to them, only to bring them misery and peril!

[विपाक: पुण्यानां etc.—The idea is to show the futility of good deeds performed in our earthly life with the object of enjoying happiness in heaven or higher lokas, for the heavenly enjoyments are transitory as being the result produced by our virtuous merits; when the force of these merits is spent, the enjoyments must cease and the soul will again be drawn back to the cycle of births and deaths, until by jñāna or spiritual illumination, it attains mokṣa or final release from the wheel of transmigration.
व्यसनमिव दातुं —It indicates that the enjoyment of pleasures in heavens binds still more fetters on us by increasing our thirst and hence is the cause of an added volume of miseries.]

Examination of the traditional place where the ṛṣi is supposed to have lived in ancient times, suggests the likelihood of the course of the river being obstructed by an extensive eminence with pervious soil and of its delayed emergence on the other side.]",https://calm-gaufre-6360e8.netlify.app/gopinath/1896-XikpAAAAYAAJ/pdf/images-300/p-316.jpg,https://calm-gaufre-6360e8.netlify.app/gopinath/1914-VeBjAAAAMAAJ/pdf/images-300/p-310.jpg,247,,,"

			[These three stanzas (Nos. 45, 46, 47) strike a rather anomalous note. Here the poet personates a man whose life has been, like the lamp burning in a deserted abode, a thorough failure. Such a man is looking back on his youthful years of unmitigated worthlessness. But are the reflections he is making here typical of those who are at the threshold of true renunciation?  By no means are they typical. The poet here simply takes up a particular case of an aspirant after renunciation which may serve his poetical purposes best. This aspirant has had in his youth no taste of glory either as a pious man, a dutiful son, a scholarly student, a brave warrior, or a lover of women. He appears to lament here that none of the fourfold aim of human life (धर्म, religious merit; अर्थ, wealth; काम, fulfilment of desires; and मोक्ष, liberation) has been pursued by him in the past with the slightest success. Perhaps he means that that is best calculated to impress on his mind the vanity of all the ends of a householder’s life. But this impression of vanity and consequent non-attachment may very well come, and come with perhaps greater completeness, to men who had the ability to succeed in life, and such men may not at all look back with any lingering regret on enjoyments they are going to leave behind, whether their harvest had been actually reaped by them or not. There is even some incon­sistency in the ring of regret running through these stanzas. But the poet is here more concerned with dramatic effect than psycho­logical precision.]

For the sake of filling the cavity of the stomach when hungry, a man of self-respect would wander from door to door with an earthen begging bowl (in hand) having its edge covered with white cloth, away in extensive woodlands or holy places, the outskirts of which are grey all over with the smoke of sacrificial fires tended by Brāhmanas versed in ritualistic niceties, and thus preserve the prāṇas, rather than live (like) a beggar from day to day among those who are socially equals.

                LIFE

                Here is the sound of lutes, and there are screams and wailing;
                Here winsome girls, there bodies old and failing;
                Here scholars' talk, there drunkards' mad commotion—
                Is life a nectared or a poisoned potion?

He makes the expression qualify the verb ‘concentrate’, explaining काम as अनुराग, or love. His meaning thus becomes: swayed by the development of love or bhakti)—Literally, (turned) away from the sway (वश) of the rise of desires.
				Enjoyments are transitory individually and in­exhaustible collectively, so we are in a never-ending wild-goose chase which brings in turns stimulation and grief. Desire produces this terrible entanglement, and hope keeps it on. Therefore don’t exert yourself for these enjoyments, but, freeing your mind from hope and desire, set it high on its supreme goal. This is the argument.

                My mind no longer loves philosophy
                No longer seeks delight in poetry,
                Contemns the paths of doubt so often trod,
                And yearns to be united with its God.

			31. In enjoyment, there is the fear of disease; in social position, the fear of falling-off; in wealth, the fear of (hostile) kings; in honour, the fear of humiliation; in power, the fear of enemies; in beauty, the fear of old age; in scriptural erudition, the fear of opponents; in virtue, the fear of traducers; in body, the fear of death. All the things of this world pertaining to man are attended with fear; renunciation alone stands for fearlessness.",https://calm-gaufre-6360e8.netlify.app/gopinath/1896-XikpAAAAYAAJ/pdf/images-300/p-401.jpg,https://calm-gaufre-6360e8.netlify.app/gopinath/1914-VeBjAAAAMAAJ/pdf/images-300/p-395.jpg,332,,,"

			87. When shall I pass the days like a moment, residing on the banks of the celestial river in Vārānasi, clad in a kaupīna (loin-cloth) and with folded hands raised to the forehead, crying out— ‘Oh Lord of Gaurī, the Slayer of Tripura, the Giver of all good, the Three-eyed, have mercy!’",,,,,,,,,
